<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>I trust that no apology is necessary for the making of this
book. It is merely a record of facts which if not soon presented
in this tangible form might easily be blotted out forever.</p>

<p>As it is intended as a history and record of Redmanship in
Kentucky only, I have made but brief mention of those intensely
interesting events leading up to the establishment of the Great
Council of the United States. They will be found recorded in the
Official History of the Order in detail, and the reader is referred
to its pages for the most complete information.</p>

<p>The records of Redmanship in Kentucky have been diligently
searched, a careful digest made of them, and I believe the information
herein contained may be regarded as authentic.</p>

<p>I am indebted to many brothers for kindly assistance in the
compilation of these pages, and I wish to thank them one and all
for the many courtesies shown me.</p>

<h3>STYLE OF DATING</h3>

<p>Prior to the year A. D. 1865, the Jewish style
namely, the Year of the World, was observed by
Red Men in dating their documents. At the Council
held in G. S. 5626, this system was discontinued and
G. S. D. (Great Sun of Discovery) was adopted, the
year of 1492 being considered G. S. D. 1. For convenience
it was determined that the Great Sun should
commence on the first of the Cold Moon, to conform
to the common era.

THE FORE-HISTORY (1765-1833).</h2>

<p>The history of the Improved Order of Red Men is so interwoven
with the history of the struggles of the American Colonies
for independence that to record the one is to repeat the other in
a great measure.</p>

<p>The first settlers upon this continent were imbued with the
spirit of freedom, and to gain this object left their mother country.
The American shores became the asylum of the oppressed of all
nationalities. They were not, however, thus easily to escape the
hand of British tyranny. The British Government soon learned
that the American colonists were a thrifty, prosperous people,
strong and skilled in the arts and sciences and were rapidly gaining
wealth. The temptation to tax these people for the maintenance
of its government and army was too strong upon the mother
country, and severe taxes were imposed; but the right of representation
in the British Parliament was denied them.</p>

<p>This usurpation of power created the greatest dissatisfaction
among the colonists, who repeatedly memorialized the English Government
for relief, and for redress for their many wrongs, but
without avail.</p>

<p>As early as 1765, it was the custom of the citizens of the city
of Boston and vicinity to assemble and discuss the aggravating
situation. Their favorite place of meeting was under the famous
Liberty Tree, which stood at what is now the corner of Essex and
Washington streets. These citizens had perfected a permanent organization,
bound together by signed pledges to appose by all
legitimate means the enforcement of the obnoxious "Stamp Act."
It is not known that at that time they had any particular name
for their organization, but Col. Barre, in a speech in the House of
Commons, February 7, 1765, referred to American colonists in
opposition to the stamp act as the "Sons of Liberty," and this
name seems to have been applied to them from that time.</p>

<p>On the 13th of May, 1766, the news of the repeal of the stamp
act was received in Boston and was celebrated under the Liberty
Tree and on the Commons with great rejoicing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>The repeal of the stamp act, however, did not satisfy the patriots.
While the excessive taxation that had been so oppressive
and burdensome had been removed, the English Government still
held to their right to tax the colonists, and did so tax them, though
in a lighter degree.</p>

<p>The Sons of Liberty called a meeting on the afternoon of the
13th of May, 1767, at Faneuil Hall and prepared a petition to the
Governor for the removal of a British warship from Boston harbor
which was there for the purpose of enforcing the taxation laws.</p>

<p>A meeting was held March 6th, in Faneuil Hall, with nearly
three thousand members present, Samuel Adams presiding, to protest
against the presence of British soldiers in the city, the result
of their presence being riot and bloodshed.</p>

<p>November 3, 1773, a meeting of the Sons of Liberty was called
under the Liberty Tree to protest against the landing of certain
ships supposed to be laden with taxable tea. Notice of the meeting
was posted, and it bore at the bottom this legend: "Show me
the man that dare take this down."</p>

<p>There is also a record of a meeting of the Sons of Liberty in
the old tavern in Providence, R. I., at about the same time, November
3, 1773.</p>

<p>On the 16th of December, 1773, occurred the famous "Boston
Tea Party," given under the auspices of the Sons of Liberty of
Boston and Vicinity.</p>

<p>On March 1, 1776, the Sons of Liberty held their first meeting
in Baltimore. Wm. Paca, a signer of the Declaration of Independence,
was the secretary. In Savannah, Ga., the first meeting
was held July 14, 1774, when they concurred in the action of
their Northern brethren. In 1765, the first meetings were held in
South Carolina, and in New York meetings were held about concurrent
with those in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>When first organized the Sons of Liberty had no thought of
Independence, but were loyal to the British crown, though protesting
against "taxation without representation."</p>

<p>Their motto was "FREEDOM," however, and as that could not
be obtained under British rule, as a last resort they determined
to be free and independent.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to here record the many deeds of heroism
performed by the Sons of Liberty, the "Liberty Boys," the "Minute
Men" and the members thereof. They will be found emblazoned
upon every page of the history of the American Revolution.</p>

<p>In many localities the Sons of Liberty adopted the title of
"Sons of Saint Tamina," or "Saint Tamina Society," and set apart
the first day of May as their anniversary.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>We quote from the Official History of the Great Council of the
United States, page 158, as follows:</p>

<p>"In this year, 1771, and for many years later, there existed in
the town of Annapolis a society called the 'Saint Tamina Society,'
who set apart the first day of May in memory of Saint Tamina,
their patron saint, whose history is now lost in fable and uncertainty.
It was usual, on the morning of this day, for the members
of this society to erect in some public location in the city 'a
May-pole,' and to decorate it in a most tasteful manner with wild
flowers, gathered from the adjacent woods, and forming themselves
in a ring around it, hand in hand, perform the 'war-dance' with
many other customs which they had seen exhibited by the 'Children
of the Forest.' It was also usual, on this day, for such of
the citizens as chose to enter into the amusements, to wear a piece
of buck-tail in their hats, or in some conspicuous part of their
dress. General invitations were given out, and a large company
usually assembled during the course of the evening, and whilst engaged
in the midst of a dance, the company would be interrupted
by the sudden intrusion of a number of the Saint Tamina Society,
habited like Indians, who, rushing violently into the room, singing
war songs and giving the 'whoop,' commenced dancing in the style
of that people. After this ceremony, they made a collection of
money, and retired evidently well pleased with their reception and
entertainment."</p>

<p>At a later date the day for celebration was changed from the
first day of May to the 12th, which is now observed as "St. Tamminy's
Day."</p>

<p>After the close of the Revolutionary War, the object for which
they had banded themselves together having been accomplished, the
Sons of Liberty, or Saint Tamina Societies, became less prominent
in public affairs, and it was the differences of opinion among the
citizens as to the permanent form the government should take that
brought them again to the front as a political organization with the
addition to their motto of "FRIENDSHIP."</p>

<p>The Saint Tamina Societies, or Societies of St. Tammany, as
they were variously called, became quite powerful in the political
affairs of the young nation and were organized in all parts of the
country from the close of the Revolutionary War up to as late
as 1820.</p>

<p>The only record we find of this Society in Kentucky is in
Ranck's History of Lexington, from which we quote the following:</p>

<p>"A St. Tammany Society was instituted in Lexington about
this time, 1811, and continued to exist up to 1820. The 'Wigwam'
was in the second story of a building which stood on the
corner of Main and Broadway. The sons of St. Tammany often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
paraded through the streets disguised as Indians, and magnificent
in red paint, feathers, bows, tomahawks, and war clubs. It was
one of the most noted Democratic organizations in the West.
Thomas T. Barr, Richard Chinn, and others successively filled the
office of 'Sachem.' We give verbatim one of the Society's orders,
viz.:</p>

<p>St. Tammany's Day.&mdash;The Sons of St. Tammany, or Brethren
of the Columbian Order, will assemble at the council fire of their
great wigwam on Tuesday, the 12th of the month of Flowers, at
the rising of the sun, to celebrate the anniversary of their patron
saint.</p>

<p>A dinner will be provided at Bro. John Fowler's garden, to
which the brethren will march in procession, where a long talk
will be delivered by one of the order.</p>

<p>An adjourned meeting of the Society will be held on tomorrow
evening, at the going down of the sun. By order of the Grand
Sachem.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">N. S. Porter</span>, Sec.</p>

<p>8th of the month of Flowers, <a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>Year of Discovery, 326."</p>

<p>During the second war with Great Britain, Fort Mifflin, on
the Delaware River, near Philadelphia, was garrisoned for a time
by a military company composed of the sons of the leading citizens
of Philadelphia. At Fort Mifflin, and among these volunteers
originated the "Society of Red Men," about the year 1813.
Their motto was "Freedom and Friendship," and they were a natural
outgrowth from and sequence to the St. Tammany Societies.</p>

<p>The records of the Society of Red Men are abundant and the
Great Council of the United States in its Official History of the
Order traces its growth and decline in detail as well as its customs
and ceremonies. It flourished until about the year 1828, when it
began to decline, and in 1832 was about extinct. The elements of
conviviality, which seems to have been inseparable from all fraternal
organizations of that period, finally produced such a degeneration
in the Society as to disgust the better element, and cause
the reorganization in its present form, and the incorporation of
the word "Improved" in its title.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br /><br />

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE IMPROVED ORDER OF RED MEN (1833-1847).</h2>

<p>In a pamphlet prepared by Bro. John F. Weishampel, Sr., containing
a long talk delivered by him on Saint Tammany's Day,
May 12, 1837, in the city of Baltimore, Md., he says:</p>

<p>"For some length of time prior to organizing the present Improved
Order of Red Men, there existed in Baltimore, Md., a lodge,
or society, called Red Men. They had their wigwam, or place of
meeting, in the garret of a tavern. They met once a week, paid
their dues, and initiated new members if any were on hand. After
the business was over, the rest of the evening was spent in singing,
telling yarns, making speeches, and convivial enjoyment, in which
the decanter largely figured. The object of the society appeared to
be only convivial entertainment. Several gentlemen who had been
induced to join the lodge, but who did not favor such a course,
withdrew as soon as they discovered the nature and object of the
society, and it soon afterwards broke up."</p>

<p>Among those who had become members of the Red Men, though
ignorant of its pernicious customs, were Geo. A. Peter and William
T. Jones, as well as a number whose names it is unnecessary to
record, yet admiring the beauties of its aboriginal ceremonies, determined
to revive the society upon a basis of sobriety, virtue and
mutual assistance in time of need.</p>

<p>Several preliminary meetings were held, at which plans, rules
and regulations for its government were discussed and adopted,
and the Tribe was duly organized under the title of Logan Tribe,
No. 1, Order of Improved Red Men, having for their motto,
"FREEDOM, FRIENDSHIP AND CHARITY."</p>

<p>The presiding chief was styled the Sachem, and the others
graded as Sagamores, Prophet, Chief of Records, Keeper of Wampum,
Guards of the Forest and Wigwam, Sanaps, Warriors and
Braves. They also later prefixed the word "Worthy" to the titles
of the chiefs.</p>

<p>Dates were computed according to the Jewish method, using the
year of the world, or, as it was called, the "Grand Sun of the world."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
A year was a "grand sun," and continued to be so styled until 1868,
when it was changed to "great sun."</p>

<p>A calendar or table of nomenclature was established, practically
the same as that now in use. The chiefs of the Tribes were elected
every three moons, which continued to be the custom for many
"grand suns."</p>

<p>After Logan Tribe had been in existence for about one great
sun, and there had also been instituted Metamora Tribe, No. 2, it
was deemed advisable to apply to the Maryland Legislature for a
charter, so that the Tribe could be recognized as an important
body. Brother John F. Weishampel, Sr., was appointed to draw
up the petition, and in so doing prepared the papers in the name
of the "Improved Order of Red Men," thus transposing the original
title, "Order of Improved Red Men." None of members seemed
to notice the alteration in the name and it therefore remained so.</p>

<p>Soon after the organization of Metamora Tribe, No. 2, it was
deemed best to form a higher body, and therefore on the 20th
sun of Flower Moon, G. S. 5595, the Grand Council of Maryland
was organized.</p>

<p>Pocahontas Tribe, No. 3, was instituted three great suns later,
and the Order was now firmly established and seemed on the
high road to success and prosperity.</p>

<p>In September, 1841, a new Tribe was instituted under the name
of Metamora Tribe, No. 4, the old Tribe, Metamora, No. 2, having
forfeited its charter and become defunct. Metamora, No. 4, did
not last long for a difficulty arose between the Tribe and the Great
Council of Maryland, and the membership withdrew and formed
the nucleus of the organization known as the Independent Order of
Red Men, composed entirely of Germans.</p>

<p>Several additional Tribes were established by the Great Council
of Maryland, and on November 4, 1845, there having previously
been established three Tribes in the District of Columbia, the
Great Council of Maryland granted a charter to the Great Council
of the District of Columbia, and it was established on that day.</p>

<p>From this time on the Order spread, until there were Tribes
in several Reservations, and on the 1st sleep of the 5th seven suns
of Cold Moon, 5607, which in the common era corresponds to
Monday, January 30, 1847, was instituted and organized the Great
Council of the United States, which was and is recognized as the
Supreme Body of the Improved Order of Red Men.

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REDMANSHIP IN KENTUCKY BY
THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE UNITED STATES, 1852.</h2>

<p>We have but the briefest record of the introduction of Redmanship
into the Reservation of Kentucky.</p>

<p>Worthy Great Incohonee Wm. Tucker, in his long talk to the
Great Council of the United States in 5613 (1852), referred to
the organization of Chickasaw Tribe, No. 1, of Newport, Kentucky,
and Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2, of Covington. The date of the
introduction of the Order into Kentucky was the 29th of Hot
Moon, G. S. 5612, (June 29, 1852). The first Prophet of Black
Hawk Tribe, No. 2, was A. J. Francis, afterwards sixteenth Great
Incohonee of the G. C. U. S.</p>

<p>There were also established the following Tribes, though we
have no record of the exact date of their institution:</p>

<p>Pocahontas Tribe, No. 3, of Newport, G. S. 5613.</p>

<p>Kentucky, No. 4, of Louisville, G. S. 5614.

THE GREAT COUNCIL OF KENTUCKY, 1854-1884.</h2>

<p>Pursuant to a notice given, the Past Sachems of Chicasaw
Tribe, No. 1, of Newport, Blackhawk Tribe, No. 2, of Covington,
and Pocahontas Tribe, No. 3, of Newport, of the Improved Order
of Red Men, assembled in Newport on the 9th of Sturgeon Moon,
G. S. 5614, for the purpose of organizing a Great Council in the
Reservation of Kentucky.</p>

<p>The following named Past Sachems were present:</p>

<p>From Chicasaw Tribe, No. 1&mdash;Geo. W. Ford, P. A. C. Kemper,
J. H. Barlow, G. D. Allen, Wm. Ostler, D. H. B. Coffin and
C. J. Murdock.</p>

<p>From Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2&mdash;V. Schinkle, E. Reese, Uriah
Schinkle, and A. J. Francis.</p>

<p>It was ordered that Kentucky Tribe, No. 4, be notified of the
institution of this Great Council and that it is now under its
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Kentucky Tribe was located in Louisville and it is probable
that it did not join in the call for the institution of the Great
Council.</p>

<p>It was agreed that the annual sessions of the Great Council
be held in the hunting grounds of Newport, and the quarterly sessions
in such place as a majority of the members present may determine
from time to time.</p>

<p>Various committees were appointed, including one on Constitution
and Laws, and the council fire was quenched, to be rekindled
on the 19th sleep of Sturgeon Moon, on which date the Great
Council met pursuant to adjournment, and the council fire was
kindled with due solemnity.</p>

<p>No important business was transacted at this council other than
the adoption of a code of Rules and By-Laws, and the council fire
was quenched to be rekindled on the 26th sleep of Sturgeon Moon.</p>

<p>At this adjourned council Representatives to the Great Council
of the United States were elected as follows: E. Reese, G. W.
Ford, and U. Schinkle, and the council fire was quenched to be
rekindled on the 2nd sleep of Traveling Moon, but did not meet
until the 16th sun, when the council fire was kindled and routine
business transacted.</p>

<p>At this session it was ordered that all Tribes in the jurisdiction
be requested to surrender the charters they had received from
the G. C. U. S., and apply to the Great Council of Kentucky for
charters.</p>

<p>The next session was held in Covington, on the 15th of Cold
Moon, 5615, when several Past Sachems presented credentials and
were admitted.</p>

<p>A petition was received from pale faces residing in Alexandria
praying for the institution of Choctaw Tribe, No. 5, in those hunting
grounds, and a dispensation was granted to kindle the council
fire.</p>

<p>The next session was held in the hunting grounds of Louisville,
on the 16th sun of Plant Moon, 5615.</p>

<p>Worthy Great Sachem Geo. W. Ford stated that he had been
appointed Vice Great Incohonee for the Southern States, and was
soon to visit New Orleans for the purpose of instituting a Tribe
there.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>It was decided that a Brother elected Prophet of a Tribe at its
institution was entitled to the honors of a Past Sachem without
passing through the chairs.</p>

<p>The council fire was then quenched in due form.</p>

SECOND GRAND SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The Great Council fire was kindled in ample form at Newport
on the 16th sun of Buck Moon, G. S. 5615.</p>

<p>Past Sachems and representatives were admitted from Chickasaw
Tribe, No. 1; Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2; Pocahontas Tribe,
No. 3; Kentucky Tribe, No. 4; Choctaw Tribe, No. 5, and Tecumseh
Tribe, No. 6, of Louisville. The records fail to show the date
of the institution of this Tribe, but it must have been during the
Great Sun 5614-5615, and was authorized to work in the German
language.</p>

<p>Great Chiefs for the ensuing Great Sun were elected and raised
up as follows:</p>

<p>Great Sachem Geo. W. Ford read the first long talk, an able
and comprehensive document. He said: "The Grand Sun just
past is the first of this Great Body. It has been one of great trial.
The Great Manitou's face has been under a cloud, our corn patches
have been barren and our vines brought forth no fruit; yet has
not the faith of the Red Man faltered. The cloud is being lifted,
our hearts are made glad, the corn and vine promise much, our
squaws and pappooses shall not go hungry, and the wampum belt
shall again be full. During the past Grand Sun two more Tribes
have been added to our number&mdash;Choctaw Tribe, No. 5, at Alexandria,
and Tecumseh Tribe, No. 6, at Louisville. In the absence
of written law I have been governed by this alone, our motto,
"Freedom, Friendship, and Charity. Freedom of thought in discussion;
Friendship in our intercourse with the brotherhood, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
Charity towards our brothers' faults, frailties and the foibles of
human nature." Speaking as he was to Past Sachems only, the following
was not only timely then, but is still pertinent and should
be heeded: "We would earnestly recommend that you attend
regularly the councils of your respective Tribes, for to you it is
natural to look for countenance and advice. It is a too common
failing that when a brother has attained the highest post of honor
for him to become remiss in his duties to his Tribe, for it is his
duty to attend the kindling of his council fire upon every occasion,
when health and private duties permit. It is essentially the province
of all past officers to guide their respective Tribes in the right path,
that they go not astray and follow the path of the evil spirit. Let
this advice sink deeply into your hearts and penetrate fruitfully
your understanding."</p>

<p>The following was adopted:</p>

<p>"Resolved: That this Great Council instruct its Representatives
to the G. C. U. S. to call the attention of that body to the subject
of establishing a chief's degree to be conferred upon the squaws
of Red Men."</p>

<p>The Great Council fire was quenched, to be rekindled in the
hunting grounds of Alexandria, on the 15th sun of Traveling Moon,
G. S. 5616.</p>

<p>On the above date the council fire was rekindled. Since the
quenching of the last council fire the Great Council of the United
States had convened, and Past Great Sachem Geo. W. Ford had
been elected Great Incohonee of that body, and he presided at this
session of the Great Council of Kentucky.</p>

<p>Several Past Sachems presented credentials and were admitted,
routine business was transacted and the council fire was quenched,
to be rekindled in the hunting grounds of Covington, on the 21st
sun of Cold Moon, G. S. 5616, on which date the Great Council
reconvened, but transacted no important business other than a
resolution to fine all Great Chiefs for non-attendance, and the
council fire was quenched, to be rekindled in the hunting grounds
of Louisville, on the 14th sun of Plant Moon, 5616.</p>

<p>At this adjourned session much business of only local interest,
however, was transacted.</p>

<p>A resolution was adopted to kindle the Great Council fire semi-annually
instead of quarterly, once in Louisville and once in Newport
or Covington.</p>

<p>The council fire was then quenched.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<h3><b>1856.</b><br /><br />

THIRD GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The council fire was kindled with due solemnities in the hunting
grounds of Newport, on the 21st sun of Buck Moon, G. S. 5616.</p>

<p>Representatives were present from Chickasaw Tribe, No. 1;
Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2; Pocahontas Tribe, No. 3, and Tecumseh
Tribe, No. 6.</p>

<p>Great Sachem Elias Reese presented his long talk, regretting
that he had not been able to institute any new Tribes, but reported
the Order in a very healthy condition.</p>

<p>The election of Great Chiefs for the Grand Sun ensuing resulted
as follows:</p>

</table>

<p>The finance committee reported total receipts for the Grand
Sun, $374.40; expenses, $324.50; balance in the wampum belt,
$49.90.</p>

<p>No business was transacted at this session worthy of being recorded
on these pages, and after the Past Great Sachem had instructed
the brethren in the secret work the Great Council fire was
quenched, to be rekindled in the hunting grounds of Louisville,
on the 13th sun of Cold Moon, G. S. 5617.</p>

<p>On the above date the Great Council reconvened, and representatives
were admitted from Kentucky Tribe, No. 4; Tecumseh, No.
6, and Delaware, No. 7.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem reported that he had granted a dispensation
for a new Tribe at Louisville, to be known as Delaware Tribe, No.
7, and that its first council fire had been kindled on the 2nd sun,
Traveling Moon, G. S. 5617.</p>

<p>Reports were received in correct form from all Tribes except
Chickasaw Tribe, No. 1, and Choctaw, No. 5, and as no further
mention is made of No. 5 in subsequent records, it is probable
that it was at this time defunct.</p>

<p>Past Great Sachem Elias Reese, Great Representative to G. C.
U. S., made a lengthy report, stating at that time there were nine
States having Great Councils, viz.: Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia,
District of Columbia, New Jersey, Ohio, Kentucky, Delaware,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
and New York, and that hereafter the Great Council of the
United States would be a representative body, exclusively. He
also reported that P. G. I. Geo. W. Ford had been appointed Vice
Great Incohonee for Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas.</p>

<p>A committee was appointed to have the Great Council of Kentucky
incorporated.</p>

<p>The council fire was then quenched.</p>

<h3><b>1857.</b><br /><br />

FOURTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The council fire was kindled in the wigwam of Black Hawk
Tribe, No. 2, Covington, on the 13th of Buck Moon, G. S. 5617.</p>

<p>Representatives were admitted from Tribes Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7.</p>

<p>The long talks of the Great Chiefs were not copied in the proceedings,
therefore no excerpts can be made from them.</p>

<p>A committee of three was appointed to draft a constitution for
the government of Tribes under the jurisdiction of this Great
Council. Previous to this time each Tribe had prepared its own
constitution as well as by-laws, subject, however, to approval by
the Great Council.</p>

<p>Chiefs for the ensuing Grand Sun were elected and raised up
as follows:</p>

<table class="list" summary=" ">

<p>After transacting the usual routine business, the council fire
was quenched, to be rekindled in the wigwam of Kentucky Tribe,
No. 4, hunting grounds of Louisville, on the 11th of Cold Moon,
G. S. 5618.</p>

<p>The Great Council reconvened, pursuant to adjournment, with
all Great Chiefs present.</p>

<p>Representatives were admitted from Tribes Nos. 2, 4, 6 and 7.</p>

<p>No business was transacted other than the payment of current
bills and acting upon a new code of by-laws for the Great Council,
and the council fire was quenched in due form.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<h3><b>1858.</b><br /><br />

FIFTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The council fire was kindled in the hunting grounds of Newport,
on the 12th of Buck Moon, G. S. 5618, all Great Chiefs being
present.</p>

<p>Representatives were present from Tribes Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 6.</p>

<p>Past Sachems were present from Kentucky Tribe, No. 4, and
Delaware, No. 7, but without credentials as representatives, and
they were refused admission, whereupon they gave notice of an
appeal to the G. C. U. S.</p>

<p>Great Sachem John Hughes, in his long talk, stated that the
Order was in good condition and that efforts were being made to
establish Tribes in Frankfort and Lexington. He complimented
the Louisville brethren for their zeal. Among his rulings was
one that a paleface being admitted under lawful age, by mistake,
should remain a member of the Tribe which had adopted him.</p>

<p>Reports of the G. C. of R. and G. K. of W. showed the Great
Council to be in debt to the Great Keeper of Wampum for 7
fathoms 1 foot and 9 inches.</p>

<p>The election for Great Chiefs for the ensuing Grand Sun resulted
as follows:</p>

<table class="list" summary=" ">

<p>Bros. Ruhl, Harig and Tyrack were elected Great Representatives
to the G. C. U. S., and were instructed that if they desired
to attend that Grand Body at their own expense they would be furnished
with credentials.</p>

<p>After passing an order to borrow 50 fathoms from Tecumseh
Tribe, No. 6, the Great Council fire was quenched, to be rekindled
in the hunting grounds of Louisville, on the 12th of Cold Moon,
G. S. 5619.</p>

<p>At the semi-grand sun session, Great Sachem John B. Davies
was not present, owing to afflictions in his family, and Past Great
Sachem A. J. Francis occupied his stump.</p>

<p>Representatives were present from Tribes Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7.</p>

<p>It was announced that Chickasaw Tribe, No. 1, of Newport,
had become defunct and its members were desirous of uniting with
some other Tribe, taking with them the property of former Chickasaw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Tribe in lieu of admission fee, and requested of the Great
Council permission so to do. Acting Great Sachem ruled the request
out of order, on the ground that the property of defunct
Chickasaw Tribe did not belong to the members, but to the Great
Council.</p>

<p>It was ordered that no Tribe shall be entitled to the pass-word,
nor shall its chiefs be raised up until its reports and percentage
have been placed in the hands of its Deputy Great Sachem.</p>

<p>The constitution was amended so as to provide for annual sessions
only, to alternate between the cities of Louisville and Covington.</p>

<p>After levying an assessment of ten fathoms upon each Tribe
under its jurisdiction, the council fire was quenched.</p>

<h3><b>1859.</b><br /><br />

SIXTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The Grand Sun Council fire was kindled in the wigwam of
Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2, hunting grounds of Covington, on the
11th of Buck Moon, G. S. 5619, Great Sachem John B. Davies
presiding.</p>

<p>Representatives were admitted from Tribes Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 6.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem, in a very brief talk, reported that Black
Hawk, Pocahontas, Kentucky, Tecumseh, and Delaware Tribes
were in a nourishing condition, a spirit of emulation pervading
their wigwams.</p>

<p>Great Chief of Records J. N. Tyrack presented a very complete
report, from which the following is gleaned: Amount in Great
Council wampum belt, 142 fathoms; number of working Tribes, 6;
members in good standing, 267; withdrawn by card, 9; adopted,
52; admitted by card, 3; rejected, 3; expulsions and suspensions,
40; deaths, 3; widows and orphans, 14; amount paid for relief of
brothers, $258.50; for relief of widows and orphans, $53.75.</p>

SEVENTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The Most Worthy Great Council of Kentucky kindled its seventh
Grand Sun Council fire in the wigwam of Delaware Tribe,
No. 7, hunting ground of Louisville, on the 9th sun of Buck
Moon, G. S. 5620, Great Sachem A. C. Herig on his stump.</p>

<p>Representatives were admitted from Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2;
Pocahontas, No. 3; Kentucky, No. 4; Tecumseh, No. 6, and Delaware,
No. 7.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem's long talk reviewed the progress of the Order
for the Grand Sun. He regretted that he had been unable to institute
any new Tribes, and called the attention of the Great Council
to the fact that there were in the possession of the Great Chief of
Records the effects of defunct Tribes Chickasaw, No. 1, and Choctaw,
No. 5, and urged that some action be taken to dispose of the
same.</p>

Chas. Amann presiding.</p>

<p>Past Sachems from Tribes Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 were in attendance.</p>

<p>In his long talk the Great Sachem said: "As all earthly joys
are tinged with sorrow, these hunting grounds of our fathers are
now clamorous with the wild and frantic war whoop. The pleasure
of this meeting is alloyed with pain. Oh, how different is the scene
presented from that of one Grand Sun ago. Everything then was
bright and prosperous, and bid fair to be the golden harvest of
ages. The fruits of the earth were abundant and our forest replete
with game.    *   *   *   I cannot report that all the Tribes in
this jurisdiction are in healthy condition, or that the most friendly
relations exist around their council fires. There have been some
grievances and misunderstandings between Tribes and our former
Great Chief of Records which caused that Great Chief to resign.
I visited all Tribes during my chieftaincy."</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records, B. Strobe, reported as follows:
Amount in wampum belt, 138 fathoms; number of working Tribes,

<p>Past Sachems were admitted from Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2;
Kentucky, No. 4; Tecumseh, No. 6, and Delaware, No. 7.</p>

<p>The following extract from the Great Sachem's long talk reveals
the condition of the Order at this time: "The events of the
past year, so fatal to the political and financial prosperity of the
country, has not been without its influence upon the prosperity
of our Order. It has prevented a great number of our chiefs from
attending the meetings of this Great Council, also from attending
their respective Tribes.    *  *  *   It is, however, our duty by
all means in our power, to make every exertion to maintain the
Order and to keep constantly in view of our respective Tribes the
beautiful motto of our Order, and the necessity of being united."</p>

<p>The following is from the report of the Great Chief of Records:</p>

<p>Number of working Tribes, 5; members, 259; deceased, 3; rejected,
1; suspended, 23; expulsions, 2: withdrawn by card, 3; paid

TENTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The Great Council assembled and the council fire was kindled
in the wigwam of Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2, hunting grounds of
Covington, on the 17th sun of Sturgeon Moon, G. S. 5623, Great
Sachem G. B. Kiteley presiding.</p>

<p>Past Sachems were admitted from Tribes Nos. 2, 4 and 6.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem said: "I am sorry that we were not able
to meet at the appointed time, according to law, but owing to the
declaring of martial law in Louisville, and the stoppage of all
travel, it was utterly impossible for the brothers from any of the
Tribes in Louisville to come here; hence the necessity of postponing
the meeting until the present time. I instituted in Kentucky
and Delaware Tribes a degree council, and would suggest the propriety
of its being done by all the Tribes, as by so doing the
brothers will get to know the unwritten work of the Order much
better than they do at present. It affords me much pleasure to
state that the Tribes are in much more flourishing condition than
they have been for some time past."</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records reported:</p>

manner, announced the death of Past Great Chief of Records,
Jas. N. Tyrack, who died on July 16, 1862, in the city of Nashville,

Sachem Borntraeger presiding, and all the elective Great Chiefs
being present.</p>

<p>Past Sachems were admitted from Tribes Nos. 4, 6 and 7.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem said: "Though it has not been our good
fortune to add another to the number of Tribes already established
in this State, I am happy to state that the initiations in some of
the Tribes have been right numerous, and the receipts of wampum
quite large. I hope that the bloody strife now raging in this our
beautiful land may soon be ended and that the Great Spirit may
spare you all for many a meeting of this Great Council."</p>

<p>Past Sachems were admitted from Tribes 3, 4 and 6.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem said: "The Order has not advanced as much
as we fondly hoped it would when the administration was placed in
our hands, yet, considering the disturbed condition of the public
mind and the distracted affairs of our beloved country, which has
alike kept the loyal and disloyal citizens in a constant fever of excitement,
we can congratulate the Great Chiefs that the Order has
not lost ground, but is steadily and surely advancing, and by the
will and assistance of the Great Spirit of the Universe the civil
strife and rebellion that has been raging for more than four Grand
Suns has at last come to a close and we are once more to have the
happiness and pleasure of peace."</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records reported as follows:</p>

<p>Notice was received from the Great Council of the United States
of the proposed change in the mode of dating, to substitute Grand
Sun of Discovery, 1492, as the base, computing from that date
as G. S. D. 1, instead of the Jewish method then in use, and the
Great Representatives were instructed to vote against the proposed
change.</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records was instructed to devise and have
printed a new form of Tribal Reports.</p>

<p>In secret session, Past Great Incohonee A. J. Francis exemplified
the unwritten work.</p>

<p>It was resolved that the Representatives to the G. C. U. S. be
requested to offer a resolution in that body by which the Representatives
may in future be elected for two years instead of one.</p>

Great Sachem Jacob Schenk presiding, and all the elective Great
Chiefs present.</p>

<p>Past Sachems were admitted from Tribes Nos. 4, 6 and 7.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem in his admirable long talk said: "The mingling
together of the honored brothers of the Order, the kind interchange
of opinions upon the various topics introduced for consideration,
the animated yet decorous discussion of various subjects,
indicate too plainly for any doubt that our beloved Order is not
only firmly established, but that a strong desire exists, not only
to keep it in its present position, but if possible to advance it to
one yet more deserving of respect. The law now is that no Tribe
is entitled to the semi-annual pass-word, nor their chiefs-elect to
installation until their reports are placed in the hands of the
D. G. S. or the Great Chief of Records. I have been instructed
by the Great Council of the United States of the change in the
mode of dating, from Grand Sun 5626 to Grand Sun of Discovery
375. Also the law of representations in the G. C. U. S. has been
changed as follows: State Great Councils shall have two Representatives
for 500 members or less, and one for every additional 500
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
or fraction exceeding 300, who are to serve for two years, but at
the first election one-half of the number are to be elected for one
year, so that their terms expire alternately. Also the mode of taxation
has been changed from a percentage basis to a per capita tax
of 5 inches."</p>

<p>From the report of the Great Chief of Records the following
is gleaned:</p>

<p>Number of working Tribes, 5; initiations, 55; rejections, 7;
suspensions, 4; expulsions, 5; reinstatements, 6; deceased, 8; withdrawn

from a number of palefaces residing in Lexington asking for a
dispensation to establish a Tribe in that city, and on the 29th of

Sag.; A. W. Trebien, C. of R.; V. N. Gardner, K. of W.;

<p>On the 25th of Traveling Moon I received a petition from a
number of Past Sachems and a few other brothers for a dispensation
to establish a new Tribe in the city of Louisville, to be known
as Seneca Tribe, No. 9. I requested Past Great Sachem Chas.
Amann to institute the Tribe, which he did, and installed the following

Sr. Sag.; P. S. Jacob Lezinski, Jr. Sag.; P. S. Tebel, C. of
R.; P. S. Ph. Leonhard, K. of W.; P. S. Isaac Lieber, Prophet.</p>

He died on the 29th of Beaver Moon. The Great Spirit has taken

Moon, G. S. D. 378, and Cherokee Tribe, No. 14, at Paris,

EIGHTEENTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The Great Council of Kentucky assembled in the wigwam of
Oswego Tribe, No. 11, at Bowling Green, on the 25th sun of Buck
Moon, G. S. D. 380, and the council fire was kindled in ample form

<p>Representatives were present from Tribes Nos. 2, 3, 4, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12 and 13.</p>

<p>From the Great Sachem's long talk: "The Order of Improved
Red Men, as far as I can judge, is progressing, notwithstanding
the desertion of two Tribes in Louisville, namely, Tecumseh, No.
6, and Delaware, No. 7. On the 16th sun of Cold Moon I visited
Tecumseh, and on the 17th of the same moon I visited Delaware,
which Tribes afterwards deserted, and as I understand joined the
Independent Order. I received a communication from Deputy
Great Sachem Alex Knapp stating their reasons for doing so, but
it does not prove that they acted like honest men. I sent a communication
to the Great Incohonee of the United States asking how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
to proceed, but I did not receive an answer. I now leave the matter
in the hands of the Great Council of Kentucky. On the 8th
sun of Flower Moon I granted a dispensation for a Tribe to be
instituted at King's Lodge, Calloway County, under the title of
Minneola Tribe, No. 15. I deputized John T. Irion, of West Tennessee,
to institute, which he did on the 6th sun, Hot Moon, G. S.
D. 380, and raised up the following chiefs: W. M. P. Pool, Sachem;
H. B. Landon, Sr. Sagamore; W. H. Clarke, Jr. Sagamore;
J. C. Shelton, Prophet; S. F. Kirkeley, C. of R.; T. A. Hughes,
Asst. C. of R.; D. G. Reed, K. of W. I would recommend that a
charter be granted them."</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records reported as follows: Tribes, 11;
members, 550; adopted, 145; rejected, 7; suspended, 28; expelled,
17; admitted by card, 18; withdrawn by card, 4; deceased, 9; new

NINETEENTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The Great Council assembled in the wigwam of Kentucky and
Seneca Tribes, hunting grounds of Louisville, and the council fire
was kindled in ample form at the 9th run, rising of the 23d sun of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Buck Moon, G. S. D. 381, Great Sachem Jacob Lezinski presiding,
all the elective Great Chiefs being present.</p>

<p>Representatives were present from Tribes Nos. 3, 4, 8, 9, 10,
11, 13 and 16.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem said: "The Order in this jurisdiction is
not making as rapid strides as it would if the beauties of it were
more fully known. Some hunting grounds are extending their influence,
while others are languishing for the want of some fraternal
care. I most respectfully recommend to your earnest consideration
the appointment of a suitable chief, one who has time and ability
to visit all the Tribes in this reservation. It is impossible for any
Great Chief without great pecuniary loss on his part to give that
attention to the visiting of Tribes, which is almost absolutely necessary
in what might be called the infancy of our Order in this jurisdiction.
I am satisfied if this system of visiting was faithfully
carried out it would increase our membership threefold and the
Tribes in general gain by it. I appointed Bro. Kiteley a special
deputy to institute Wyandotte Tribe, No. 16, at Maysville, which
he did on the 10th of Sturgeon Moon, 380, and raised up the following
chiefs: M. C. Russell, Sachem; E. A. Robinson, Sr. Sagamore;
J. H. Hall, Jr. Sagamore; A. Brillstein, Prophet; Thomas
A. Davis, C. of R.; A. B. Cochran, K. of W."</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records reported that some mode should be
adopted to compel Tribes to be more prompt in making their reports.</p>

<p>The death of Past Great Sachem Charles Amann was reported
and suitable resolutions were passed.</p>

TWENTIETH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The Great Council assembled in regular session in the wigwam
of Hiawatha Tribe, No. 13, hunting grounds of Covington, on the
22nd sun of Buck Moon, G. S. D. 382, and the council fire was
kindled in ample form at the 9th run, rising of the sun, Great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
Sachem W. H. Glore presiding. All the elective Great Chiefs were
present.</p>

<p>Representatives were admitted from the following Tribes: Nos.
2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 13 and 16.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem said: "Our Order has not been as progressive
for the past great sun as it might or ought to have been. We have
not instituted a new Tribe, and the brothers have to a certain degree
been very negligent, as well as myself, in the working and
interest of the Order. I would suggest that some active brother be
appointed by this Great Council, and make it his duty to visit every
Tribe in the State at least once in every four moons, to build them
up and give the secret work as laid down by the Great Council of
the United States. At present Matamora Tribe, No. 12, at Hopkinsville,
is suspended, and has been for some time back. I am
sorry to say that Seneca Tribe, No. 9, at Louisville, has suspended."</p>

<p>The committee appointed at the lest session to wait upon A. J.
Francis, late Great Keeper of Wampum, reported unable to make
a settlement with him, and asked that another committee be appointed,
which was done.</p>

<p>Resolved: That the Great Chief of Records be instructed to
summons Brother A. J. Francis to appear before the Great Council
at its next session, 1874, and show cause why he should not make
proper settlement to this Great Council, or be expelled from all
rights and privileges of the Great Council of Kentucky.</p>

TWENTY-FIRST GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The Great Council of Kentucky assembled in regular session in
the wigwam of Wyandotte Tribe, No. 16, on the 28th sun of Buck
Moon, G. S. D. 383, and the council fire was kindled in due form,
Great Sachem Thos. A. Hornsey presiding.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>Representatives were admitted from the following Tribes: Nos.
2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 13 and 16.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem said: "Though we have been visited by pestilence
since we last met together in council, we should return
heartfelt thanks to the Great Spirit that so many of us are permitted
to meet this sun around our council fire. I visited every
Tribe in our reservation and I found them in good working condition,
and my visitations have fully persuaded me that the frequent
visits of the Great Sachem of the State to the various Tribes is of
the very greatest importance. I deputized Great Prophet E. H.
Mottley to visit Hopkinsville in endeavor to resuscitate Matamora
Tribe, No. 12, but without success, and he took into his keeping
the charge books and jewels of the Tribe."</p>

<p>The committee on the A. J. Francis matter reported that they
had accepted his note for the amount, which would be due on the
20th of Corn Moon, 383, and the Great Sachem was instructed to
sue in case the note was not paid.</p>

<p>A petition was received from various palefaces, colored citizens
of Newport, praying for a charter to establish a Tribe. The petition
was laid on the table.</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records reported as follows: Number of
Tribes, 8; members, 480; adoptions, 57; reinstated, 2; admitted by
card, 4; withdrawn by card, 10; expelled, 28; suspended, 72; rejected,
4; deceased, 8; Past Sachems, 8.</p>

<p>The number of expulsions reported, not only at this, but at other
councils, indicates that but little care was taken in the selection of
the material of which the Tribes were composed.</p>

<p>The finance committee reported that there was $132 in the
hands of the Great Chief of Records not accounted for, and the
Great Keeper of Wampum not being present, nor his books, an
adjustment could not be reached.</p>

TWENTY-SECOND GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The Great Council met in the wigwam of Minnehaha Tribe,
No. 10, hunting grounds of Newport, on the 27th sun of Buck
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
Moon, G. S. D. 384, the council fire being kindled in due form,
Great Senior Sagamore J. F. Follett presiding, the Great Sachem
being absent.</p>

<p>Representatives were admitted from Tribes Nos. 2, 3, 4, 10
and 13.</p>

<p>The Great Senior Sagamore in his long talk said: "By the
surrender of the charter of Wyandotte Tribe, the Great Sachem,
Thos. A. Davis, is an absentee from our council today, and I am
illy prepared to entertain you with an account of the workings of
our Order in the State during the past great sun. I can confidently,
though with regret, say that the Order has retrograded to a considerable
extent. Osceola Tribe, No. 8, of Lexington, surrendered shortly
after our last Great Council, and Wyandotte Tribe, on the 8th
sleep of Buck Moon, last past, and to the best of my knowledge none
of those in existence can boast of doing deeds to add additional
feathers in their crests. In the absence of facts whereupon to base
an opinion, I am unable to offer any suggestion, except to recommend
an effort individually to carry out the tenets of our Order,
especially in the wigwam, and when the lessons of Freedom, Friendship
and Charity shall have been thoroughly learned there, our
associations with the outer world will certainly be more pleasant,
and we can give our brothers in the forest as well as in the wigwam
the warm grasp of friendship and another knot to the cord that
binds us as brothers." The Great Senior Sagamore, continuing,
called the attention of the Great Council to laxity of Tribes and
individuals in obeying the laws, and recommended their revision.
He cited several decisions made by him and dispensations granted.
"On the sleep of the 27th sun of Plant Moon, G. S. D. 384, I
granted a dispensation to Minnehaha Tribe to turn out in procession
to assist in laving of the corner stone of a new market
house in Newport. I did this at the earnest request of some of
the members of the Tribe, believing at the time that whenever the
fact of our existence was brought to the public notice it would be
to the good of the Order. I have since been cured of the delusion.
Finally, let it be borne in mind that the one thing needful in the
Order and to maintain our organization is to elect chiefs who can
and will do their duty, and see that the several Tribes of this
jurisdiction maintain a proper discipline, and that ignorance, coupled
with incompetency, shall not be the means of destroying our
Order in the State of Kentucky. I thank you for listening to an
ill excuse for what should be the journal of your Great Sachem."</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records reported: "Cash in hands of Great
Keeper of Wampum, $233.19; number of Tribes, 6; members, 415;
adoptions, 14; suspensions, 57; expulsions, 26; reinstatements, 2;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>

<p>An extra session was called in the wigwam of Minnehaha Tribe,
No. 10, on the 23d of Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 385, when charges
were preferred against Great Keeper of Wampum W. G. Stone for
conduct unbecoming a Great Chief. There is no records of a trial,
and probably the charges were not sustained, if there was one, for
Bro. Stone was subsequently twice elected Great Chief of Records.</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records was instructed to notify Brother
A. J. Francis that he stood expelled from this Great Council, and
that he also notify Brother Francis' Tribe of the fact.</p>

<p>Thus ingloriously comes to end the career of a brilliant Red
Man. He had held every position of honor and trust that could
have been conferred upon him. A. J. Francis successively held the
positions of Great Chief of Records, Great Sachem, Great Incohonee
of the G. C. U. S., Great Representative to G. C. U. S. for
many Great Suns, and Great Keeper of Wampum of the Great
Council of Kentucky for eleven Great Suns.</p>

KENTUCKY UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE GREAT COUNCIL OF OHIO, 1884-1894.</h2>

<p>We quote from the official history of the Great Council of the United
States:</p>

<p>"Kentucky&mdash;Chickasaw Tribe, No. 1, of Newport, and Black
Hawk, No. 2, of Covington, were both instituted in G. S. 5612,
1852. Pocahontas Tribe, No. 3, of Newport, and Kentucky, No.
4, of Louisville, were instituted in the following grand sun. The
Great Council fire was lighted on the 9th of Sturgeon Moon, G. S.
5614, 1854. The Order in Kentucky flourished for many great
suns, but finally began to lose interest and membership, and was
not represented in the G. C. U. S. after G. S. D. 398. In G.
S. D. 395, but one Tribe was reported in the State&mdash;Miami, No. 17,
of Newport. The Great Council fire had long ceased to burn. In
G. S. D. 397 Kentucky was placed under the jurisdiction of the
Great Council of Ohio, and the standing of its Tribes on the 30th
of Hot Moon, G. S. D. 401, is included in the statement given for
that reservation. During its existence as a Great Council, Kentucky
furnished two Great Incohonees to the G. C. U. S."</p>

<p>While under the jurisdiction of the Great Council of Ohio the
following Tribes were instituted in Kentucky:</p>

<p>Shawnee Tribe, No. 18, was instituted at Winchester in G. S.
D. 396 (1887), by B. W. Kline, a German living in Cincinnati,
and holding a minor chieftaincy in the Great Council of Ohio.
He visited Winchester on business, and being an enthusiastic Red
Man, immediately set about the organization of a Tribe. In less
than two days he had secured a list of petitioners, and in a couple
of seven suns he returned and instituted Shawnee Tribe, No. 18,
under the jurisdiction of the Great Council of Ohio. C. E. Lyddane
was the first Sachem, who ten years later was Great Chief of
Records for five great suns, and now ranks as a Past Great Sachem.
After the Tribe was organized it received no further attention from
the Great Council of Ohio, was never visited by any of its Great
Chiefs, and was never represented in its Great Council. Red Men
were very scarce and a visitor was a rare occurrence. However,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
Shawnee grew and flourished and for several great suns held regular
meetings. A loft of Haymakers was instituted and sometimes
the fun was so fast and furious that the police threatened to interfere.
The Tribe finally died of pure neglect and loneliness. It
had considerable amount of wampum in its belt, which was parceled
out to the members in good standing. The love of Redmanship
did not die in the breast of its members, however, and when
in G. S. D. 403 Miantonomo Tribe, No. 1, was organized at Lexington,
among its charter members were several of those who had
belonged to old Shawnee, No. 18, and it was very little trouble a
few seven suns later to kindle the council fire of Onequa, No. 2,
amid the ashes of the old Tribe. Some of the members of old
Shawnee have lapsed from the Order, some have passed to the
Eternal Hunting Grounds, while others are still found around the
council fire and are training a new generation in Freedom, Friendship
and Charity.</p>

<p>Osceola, No. 19, at Ashland, on the 26th of Buck Moon, G. S.
D. 399, with 15 charter members, Harry C. McKay being then
Great Sachem. This Tribe is still in existence, and is one of the
strongest in the reservation.</p>

<p>Mohawk, No. 20, at Louisville, on 1st Hot Moon, G. S. D. 400.
At the institution of this Tribe it was hoped that Redmanship
would be once more revived in Kentucky and would flourish, but
the anticipation of its founders were not realized, as it lived but a
short time and was never prosperous.

KENTUCKY UNDER A DEPUTY GREAT INCOHONEE, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TRIBES
BY THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE UNITED STATES, 1894.</h2>

<p>In the summer of G. S. D. 403, there came to the hunting
grounds of Lexington J. B. Mendenhall, holding a commission as
Deputy for Great Incohonee Andrew H. Paton. Mendenhall held
a withdrawal card from Ninegret Tribe, No. 21, of New London,
Conn. Where he received his honors as a Past Sachem is not known,
as it is certain he was not known as a Past Sachem in Ninegret
Tribe. During the autumn of this great sun Mendenhall began
an active canvas for petitioners for a charter for a Tribe of Red
Men in Lexington, and with the assistance of O. R. King, J. R.
McConnell, and others he was abundantly successful, so that on
the 15th of Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 403, he had a list of 121
accepted applicants, including Past Great Sachem Thos. A. Hornsey,
formerly a member of old Osceola, No. 8, of these hunting
grounds, who deposited his withdrawal card from that Tribe. On
the above date the Tribe was instituted in the Opera House by
Great Incohonee A. H. Paton, of Massachusetts, assisted by Great
Chief of Records of the G. C. U. S., Charles C. Conley, of Pennsylvania;
Past Great Incohonee and National Exemplifier Thos.
K. Donnalley, of Philadelphia; Great Sachem of Illinois, Wilson
Brooks, of Chicago, and Past Great Sachem Judge Alfred Ellison,
of Indianapolis, Ind. The work of the Adoption Degree was exemplified
by the chiefs of the new Tribe, the National Exemplifier
having been drilling them for several suns, and it is doubtful if
the work done by the team at that time has ever been excelled in
this reservation. Immediately the Tribe was instituted its members
began active efforts to establish other Tribes in their vicinity,
and under the leadership of Deputy Great Incohonee J. B. Mendenhall,
Miantonomo Tribe, No. 1, of Lexington, of which he
was now a member, assisted in the institution of the following
Tribes:</p>

<p>Onequa Tribe, No. 2, at Winchester, on the 29th of Cold Moon,
G. S. D. 404, with 41 charter members, of whom 18 had previously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
taken membership in Miantonomo Tribe, No. 1, and became
members of Onequa, No. 2, by the deposit of withdrawal cards.
Many of these members had been formerly members of Old Shawnee
Tribe, No. 18.</p>

<p>Wyandotte Tribe, No. 3, at Maysville, on the 3d of Hot Moon,
G. S. D. 404, with 35 charter members, including many members
of old Wyandotte Tribe, No. 16, one of whom was Past Great
Sachem Thos. A. Davis.</p>

<p>Winona Tribe, No. 4, at Lexington, on the 24th of Hot Moon,
G. S. D. 404, with 25 charter members.</p>

<p>Tecumseh Tribe, No. 5, at Harrodsburg, on the 27th of Hot
Moon, G. S. D. 404, with 25 members.</p>

<p>Paughcaughnaughsinque Tribe, No. 6, at Augusta, on the 1st
of Beaver Moon, G. S. D. 404, with 41 charter members.</p>

<p>Hiawatha Tribe, No. 7, at Louisville, on the 6th of Hunting
Moon, G. S. D. 404. with 63 charter members.</p>

<p>Cherokee Tribe, No. 8, at Louisville, on the 22d of Hunting
Moon, 404.</p>

<p>Minnehaha Council, No. 2, Degree of Pocahontas, at Lexington,
with a charter membership of 49, on the 28th of Worm Moon, 404.</p>

<p>Charters were issued to the foregoing by the Great Council of
the United States.</p>

<p>In his long talk to the Great Council of the United States in
Corn Moon, G. S. D. 404, Great Incohonee Andrew H. Paton said:</p>

<p>"More than forty great suns ago a Great Council fire was kindled
in Kentucky, which was extinguished after burning somewhat
feebly for about thirty great suns. In G. S. D. 397 the few members
in the State were by this great Council placed under the jurisdiction
of Ohio. The Order here, as it has in some of the other
States we are trying to reorganize, had fallen into disrepute because
of the carelessness, bad management, and vicious material
which had been admitted into the Tribes. Although these characteristics
had ceased to be, the Order was and is yet suffering in
that State because of what had been, and the Great Council of Ohio
found itself unable to overcome the prejudices which prevailed.
Under these circumstances it seemed better to place the interests
of the Order in Kentucky in charge of some one on the ground,
who could give them personal oversight. By consent of our Board
of Great Chiefs the Great Sachem of Ohio was visited, and at a
meeting of the Great Chiefs of Ohio and several of its Representatives
and ex-Representatives to this body, arrangements were made
by which Ohio resigned its control of Kentucky except of the two
Tribes, the fires of which were then burning. At the Great Sun
Council of Ohio in Flower Moon, it was voted that its authority
over these two Tribes should be withdrawn this Cold Moon. By
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
good fortune, an enthusiastic Red Man from Connecticut, Brother
J. B. Mendenhall, had taken up his residence in Lexington, Kentucky,
and arrangements were made with him to rebuild the Order
in the State. In spite of many obstacles, and at much cost of labor
and wampum, Brother Mendenhall has added five Tribes to the
two existing at the time of his appointment, and of material which
is an ornament to the fraternity. A Great Council of Kentucky is
therefore also within sight. No member of the Order has made
more sacrifices the past great sun for the Improved Order of Red
Men than has Brother Mendenhall. He has spent his time, his
efforts, and his wampum without stint and under circumstances
which often gave good excuse to do otherwise."</p>

<p>On the 7th sun of Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 404, Deputy Great
Incohonee J. B. Mendenhall addressed a circular letter to all Tribes
and Past Sachems in the Reservation of Kentucky, from which the
following extracts are made:</p>

<p>"Your attention is again directed to my talk of the 11th sun of
Beaver Moon, relative to the institution of the Great Council of
Kentucky.</p>

<p>Miantonomo Tribe, No. 1, adopted 106 pale faces last sleep,
and I will institute Hiawatha Tribe, No. 7, at Louisville, Ky., on
the 9th sleep of this moon, with about 70 charter members. This
will give us a total of about 700 members and 50 past Sachems in
good standing.</p>

<p>Every Past Sachem will therefore take notice and make a
special effort to be present in the hunting grounds of Lexington on
the 27th and 28th suns of Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 404.</p>

<p>The council fire will be kindled at the 10th run, rising of
the sun, and the Great Council Degree conferred upon all Past
Sachems then in waiting, and the transaction of business will begin
immediately thereafter.</p>

<p>The institution will take place in Red Men's Hall, 38 East
Short street.</p>

<p>Osceola Tribe, No. 18, Ashland, and Miami Tribe, No. 17,
Newport, are now under my jurisdiction, and they will pay their
per capita tax to the Great Council of Kentucky, as soon as instituted,
instead of to the Great Council of Ohio."</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records of the Great Council of the United
States, in his report to the G. C. U. S. for G. S. D., gives the following
statistics for the Tribes in Kentucky under the jurisdiction
of the G. C. U. S., which does not include Miami, No. 17, and
Osceola, No. 18:</p>

<p>Number of Tribes, 5; adopted, 267; admitted by card, 2; withdrawn
by card, 20; Past Sachems, 26: total membership, 249.</p>

in Kentucky, Great Chief of Records of the Great Council of the
United States, Charles C. Conley, acting Great Incohonee, and Past
Great Sachem William C. Conley, of Pennsylvania, acting Great

<p>Osceola Tribe, No. 19&mdash;W. C. Diederich.</p>

<p>As Past Sachems McConnell, Diederich and Mendenhall had
been admitted to other State Great Councils, the acting Great Incohonee
appointed Past Sachem McConnell as Great Guard of the
Forest, pro tem.; Past Sachem Diederich as Great Guard of the
Wigwam, pro tem.; and Great Sannap, pro tem., was filled by Past
Sachem Mendenhall.</p>

<p>The acting Great Incohonee, assisted by the acting Great Chief
of Records and Past Sachem Mendenhall proceeded to constitute
the Great Council of Kentucky, which was consummated at 12
o'clock high sun.

SECOND GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The second Great Sun Council fire of the Great Council of
Kentucky, Improved Order of Red Men was kindled in the wigwam
of Paughcaughnaughsinque Tribe, No. 6, at the 10th run rising of
the 12th sun of Flower moon, G. S. D. 405, with Great Sachem
J. B. Mendenhall presiding. All of the elective Great Chiefs were
present except A. F. German, Great Keeper of Wampum.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem appointed the following named brothers as a
committee on Credentials&mdash;John I. Winter, of No. 6, John Armstrong
of No. 1 and J. W. Crumbaugh, of No. 6.</p>

<p>The committee on credentials reported representatives present
with proper credentials from Tribes, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 17,
and 19, and recommended that they be recognized and seated as the
representatives from their respective Tribes, which was concurred in.</p>

<p>The committee also reported the following named Past Sachems
as being in the forest for the first time with proper credentials and
recommended that they be admitted and receive the Great Council
Degree, which was agreed to:</p>

<p>Miantonomo, No. 1&mdash;H. H. Wilson.</p>

<p>Onequa, No. 2&mdash;J. W. Scobee.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>Wyandotte, No. 3&mdash;W. C. Pelham and D. P. Ort.</p>

<p>Winona, No. 4&mdash;L. E. Pearce.</p>

<p>Paughcaughnaughsinque, No. 6&mdash;J. W. McKibben, W. E.
Hamilton, Thos. M. Gray and N. Feagan.</p>

<p>Cherokee, No. 8&mdash;Chas. A. Lang.</p>

<p>Osceola, No. 19&mdash;Conrad Gensler.</p>

<p>Past Sachem Michael Grau, of No. 17, having previously been
admitted to the Great Council of Ohio, was also admitted to a
seat in the Great Council of Kentucky.</p>

<p>The records of the last Great Council were approved as printed.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem then began reading his long talk, and we
make the following extracts therefrom:</p>

<p>"I herewith submit the report of my official actions between
27th Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 404, at which time this G. C. was
instituted, and 11th Flower Moon, 405.</p>

<p>The Order in this reservation has enjoyed a season of prosperity,
and the membership has, through hard work, been greatly
increased. The following new Tribes have been instituted:</p>

<p>Shawnee, No. 9, Louisville, on the 10th of Worm Moon;
Mohican, No. 11, Bowling Green, on the 24th of Plant Moon, and
three Tribes will be instituted before the close of this moon.</p>

<p>All of our Tribes, with the exception of Miami, No. 17, and
Tecumseh, No. 5, have greatly increased their membership, as will
be seen from the report of the G. C. of R.</p>

<p>I regret to say that some opposition on the part of some of
the members of Cherokee Tribe, No. 8, has been manifested in
regard to fee paid to organizers, and this matter will, in all probability,
be presented by their representatives for your consideration
at this session.</p>

<p>Hiawatha Tribe, No. 7, labored under the impression that no
other Tribe could legally be instituted in the hunting ground of
Louisville without first obtaining their consent, and it was necessary
for me to summon the Great Chiefs to meet with that Tribe
on the sleep of the 28th of Snow Moon, and after considerable discussion
the matter was amicably adjusted, and they have since
prospered."</p>

<p>The Great Sachem then recounted appointment of Deputies for
each Tribe, dispensations granted, decisions rendered and visitations
made.</p>

<p>Among his recommendations were the following:</p>

<p>"That the salary of the Great Chief of Records be increased to
three hundred fathoms." This was approved by the finance committee
and concurred in by the Great Council.</p>

<p>That the Great Sachem be allowed to draw on the Great
Keeper of Wampum for the expenses of that stump, from time to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
time, as they may become necessary." This was agreed to after
fixing the limit at one hundred fathoms.</p>

<div class="figcenter w100">

<p class="caption">GREAT COUNCIL OF KENTUCKY--SECOND SESSION, AUGUSTA, MAY 12-13, 1896.</p>

<p><small>Great Chiefs Seated--N. Feagan, G. of W. Frank L. Smith, G. C. of R. W.
E. Fite, G. Sr. Sag. J. R. McConnell, Gt. Sachem. J. B. Mendenhall, Gt.
Prophet. J. I. Winter, G. Jr. Sag. John Armstrong, G. K. of W.</small></p>
</div>

<p>The Great Chief of Records in his report said:</p>

<p>"The work of a full great sun has been crowded into the short
space of four and one-half moons, owing to the peculiar time of
kindling our first Great Council fire.</p>

<p>The placing of the Great Council upon a footing to transact
business has required me to cause to be printed not only the records
of the first Great Council, but also the laws, blanks for dispensations,
reports, credentials, stationery, etc., that will not have to be
done again for many great suns.</p>

<p>Having been authorized by the Great Council to prepare an
original design for a seal, I set about the same, and caused a skillful
draftsman to carry out my ideas in an India ink drawing, from
which seals were engraved on wood in two sizes, and a die sunk and
the seal properly prepared. The design proved a difficult one to
execute and was quite expensive, yet when I considered that it was
to last for all time as the Great Seal of the Great Council of Kentucky,
I felt warranted in making the expenditure, as the design
has been highly commended by the Great Chiefs to whom it was
submitted.</p>

<p>I beg to submit for the consideration of the Great Council
the system I have adopted for listing, by means of a card catalogue,
the entire membership of the Order in this reservation. I
have caused to be printed two thousand cards like sample filed herewith.
These cards are filled out, one for each member, with all
the information obtainable as to the history and rank in the Order,
and are filed alphabetically. This system, started from the institution
of the Great Council and kept up to date from the semi-great
sun's reports from Tribes, will enable the G. C. of R. at a
moment's notice, by referring to the catalogue, to tell the Tribe
to which any brother named may belong, when and where he was
adopted, advanced, raised and exalted; also whether or no he is a
Past Sachem, and if he has been admitted to the Great Council
of Kentucky. It will also show if he has ever been suspended, reinstated,
withdrawn, readmitted, etc., with dates in every case. In
the future, I am of the opinion this will prove to be of inestimable
value. I now have the catalogue of the Order in a complete
state up to the first of Plant Moon.</p>

<p>In order that this system may be carried out in every particular,
I have prepared a special report blank, which, if the Chiefs
of Records of Tribes will be particular to comply with, will enable
the list to be kept complete and accurate.</p>

<p>I have been unable to obtain any report for the last term from
Tecumseh Tribe, No. 5, or even an answer to any of my letters,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
though the last one was registered to insure its receipt by the
C. of R."</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records made the following recommendations:</p>

<p>1st. That the Card Catalogue system, as inaugurated by the G.
C. of R., be approved and adopted.</p>

<p>2nd. That the report blank in connection therewith be approved
and adopted, and Tribes be required to report in accordance
therewith.</p>

<p>3rd. That each Tribe be required to place on file with the
G. C. of R. a copy of their by-laws in printed form.</p>

<p>4th. That the price schedule of supplies as printed in the first
records be approved and adopted.</p>

<p>5th. That the G. C. of R. be forbidden to furnish or supply
any individual members of the Order with any supplies whatever,
except it be a question book and necessary literature for the purpose
of instituting new Tribes and charter supplies to new Tribes,
and to Tribes only when ordered under the seal of the Tribe, and
in no case unless paid for when ordered, in current funds.</p>

<p>These five recommendations were reviewed by the committee
on the state of the Order, approved by them and were then adopted
by the Great Council.</p>

<p>The following statistics are drawn from the report of the Great
Chief of Records: Whole number of members at time of institution,
623; adopted since, 525; admitted by card, 3; reinstated, 2;
suspended, 7; withdrawn, 4; number of members in Tribe failing
to report, 17; whole number at present time, 1,125; rejected, 19;

No. 6; W. C. Pelham, No. 3.</p>

Ort, No. 3.</p>

<p>On Grievances&mdash;John I. Winter, No. 6; J. R. McConnell, No.
1; L. E. Pearce, No. 4.</p>

<p>The long talks of the various Great Chiefs were referred to the
proper committees.</p>

<p>Telegrams of congratulation were ordered sent to the various
Great Councils holding concurrent councils.</p>

<p>A special committee was appointed to make arrangements for
having the Great Council photographed.</p>

<p>The Committee on Law and Usage recommended that the various
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
dispensations granted by the Great Sachem be approved, and
they also reported having approved of the by-laws of several Tribes,
and the report of the committee was concurred in.</p>

<p>The Committee on Charters recommended that charters be issued
to Shawnee Tribe, No. 9, at Louisville, and Mohican Tribe,
No. 11, at Bowling Green, which was approved.</p>

<p>The Committee on Returns and Reports reported having examined
the reports of the various Tribes, and finding them correct
in the main, recommended that they be approved, and the report
was concurred in.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee reported having examined the reports
of the Great Chief of Records and the Great Keeper of Wampum
and found them correct, and their report was concurred in.</p>

<p>The Mileage Committee reported the mileage account of the
Great Chiefs and Representatives, and their report was approved
and warrants for the payment of the same were ordered drawn.</p>

<p>The election of Great Chiefs resulted as follows:</p>

<p>Great Sachem Mendenhall took occasion to officially thank
Paughcaughnaughsinque Tribe, No. 6, for its munificent gift of
a Past Great Sachem's jewel in a few well chosen words.</p>

<p>The matter of the solution of the financial problem for the ensuing
six moons was referred to a special committee as follows:
John D. Walker, of No. 4; Chas. A. Lang, of No. 8; R. Eason,
of No. 1.</p>

<p>It was voted that the Great Representatives be instructed to
vote for and use their influence in favor of the anti-saloon law
before the Great Council of the United States. Rep. Chas. A.
Lang, of No. 8, wished to be recorded as voting nay.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>The Special Committee on Finance recommended that the Great
Chiefs be instructed to borrow five hundred fathoms to meet the
necessary demands upon the Great Council, and their recommendation
was adopted.</p>

<p>It was ordered that the Great Chiefs take immediate steps to
incorporate the Great Council of Kentucky.</p>

<p>Rep. Chas. A. Lang, of No. 8, presented a complaint from Cherokee
Tribe, No. 8, regarding the disposition of the fees collected
from charter members of that Tribe, and it was ordered that the
whole matter of the investigation of the differences between the
Louisville Tribes and the Great Council of Kentucky be referred
to the incoming Committee on Appeals and Grievances.</p>

<p>The bonds of the Great Chief of Records and the Great Keeper
of Wampum were presented and approved.</p>

<p>The following resolution was adopted:</p>

<p>Resolved: That organizers of Tribes in this reservation shall
be allowed as commission and fee for services rendered in institution,
one-half the fees collected from charter members, the said
fee to be for his own use, and all other wampum collected, after
deducting the necessary expenses of institution, such as traveling
expenses of instituting chiefs, charter fee, etc., shall be paid into
the wampum belt of the Tribe by the organizer, and he shall make
an itemized statement of said expenses.</p>

<p>The following resolution was also adopted by a unanimous rising
vote:</p>

<p>Resolved: That the thanks of the Great Council be extended to
Paughcaughnaughsinque Tribe, No. 6, for the use of their wigwam
for the meeting of this Great Council, for the very efficient
manner in which its members have entertained the members of this
body, and to the kind ladies and citizens of Augusta for the elegant
banquet given, as well as for all the numerous courtesies which
we have received at their hands. We beg leave to assure them, one
and all, who have in any way contributed to our pleasure while in
their midst, that we shall ever look back with pleasure to our
meeting in their beautiful city.</p>

<h3><b>1897.</b><br /><br />

THIRD GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The third Great Sun Council fire of the Great Council of Kentucky
was kindled in the wigwam of Osceola Tribe, No. 19, on
the 11th sun of Flower Moon, G. S. D. 406, at the 10th run, 30th
breath, rising of the sun, Great Sachem J. R. McConnell presiding.
All Great Chiefs were present except John Armstrong, Great
Keeper of Wampum, and N. Feagan, Great Guard of Wigwam.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem made the following appointments, pro tem:</p>

<p>Great Guard of the Wigwam, John D. Walker, No. 4.</p>

<p>Great Keeper of Wampum, Mat. M. Gay, No. 18.</p>

<p>The Great Junior Sagamore reported the credentials of the following
named Past Sachems as being in proper form, and they
being in waiting were introduced and instructed in the Great Council
Degree.</p>

<p>Miantonomo, No. 1&mdash;W. B. Eason.</p>

<p>Onequa, No. 2&mdash;J. W. Shearer.</p>

<p>Wyandotte, No. 3&mdash;Frank H. Bromley.</p>

<p>Winona, No. 4&mdash;C. M. Chasteen.</p>

<p>Paughcaughnaughsinque, No. 6&mdash;Geo. H. Bandle.</p>

<p>Osceola, No. 19&mdash;C. E. Horrocks, J. F. Horstman, Thos. F.
Cassida, M. A. Rodgers.</p>

<p>The records of the previous Great Council were approved as
printed.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem then read his long talk. Therein he reported
the institution of the following Tribes.</p>

<p>Iroquois Tribe, No. 12&mdash;at Hopkinsville, on the 28th of Flower
Moon, G. S. D. 405.</p>

<p>Totewa Tribe, No. 14, at Owensboro, on the 4th of Buck Moon,
G. S. D. 405.</p>

<p>Otego Tribe, No. 15, at Paducah, on the 21st of Sturgeon Moon,
G. S. D. 405.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>Seminole Tribe, No. 16, at Henderson, on the 25th of Sturgeon
Moon, G. S. D. 405.</p>

<p>Calumet Tribe, No. 18, at Mt. Sterling, on the 14th of Hunting
Moon, G. S. D. 405.</p>

<p>Choctaw Tribe, No. 20, at Corbin, on the 22nd of Plant Moon,
G. S. D. 406.</p>

<p>A list of 128 questions had been propounded to the Great Sachem
by Miantonomo Tribe, No. 1, to which he made answers in
his long talk, and they were reviewed by the Committee on Law
and Usage, approving the Great Sachem's decisions in most cases
and altering and reversing them in some instances. These decisions
formed the digest of the Great Council of Kentucky at that
time.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem said: "Having received due notice that
Brother J. B. Mendenhall, of Paughcaughnaughsinque Tribe, No.
6, had been expelled from all rights and privileges of said Tribe,
I declared his office of Great Prophet and Great Representative to
the G. C. U. S. vacant and appointed P. G. S. Thos. A. Hornsey,
of No. 1, as Great Prophet, and Past Sachem Chas. A. Land, of
No. 8, as Great Representative to the G. C. U. S.</p>

<p>On the 7th sun of Plant Moon I learned that Seminole Tribe,
No. 16, had ceased to kindle its council fire, and was contemplating
disposing of their rituals to pale faces. I therefore appointed Bro.
G. B. Vargason, of Totewa Tribe, No. 14, as a special Deputy to
visit Henderson and arrest their dispensation and secure all property
of said Tribe, and to get possession of rituals at all hazards."</p>

<p>The Great Sachem also reported the expulsion of E. G. Van
Zandt, of Hiawatha Tribe, No. 7.</p>

<p>He reported a list of dispensations granted, which were approved
by the Great Council, after having been reviewed by the
proper committee.</p>

<p>He also said: "On the second sun of Corn Moon, 405, I received
appeal of E. G. Van Zandt from the action of Hiawatha
Tribe, No. 7, in expelling him from the Order, which I have referred
to the Board of Appeals. Also that of J. B. Mendenhall,
from Paughcaughnaughsinque Tribe, No. 6, which is in the hands
of the Board of Appeals for their consideration.</p>

<p>During the past great sun one Tribe has ceased to kindle its
council fire, that of Tecumseh Tribe, No. 5. Heroic efforts were
made by Great Chief of Records F. L. Smith to keep their council
fire burning, but to no purpose."</p>

<p>Among the recommendations made by the Great Sachem were
the following:</p>

<p>"That this Great Council define explicitly what is the legitimate
expenses of organizer in instituting Tribes." This matter was referred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
to a special committee, who reported a code of rules to govern
organizers for the ensuing great sun, and to come up for consideration
as an amendment to the by-laws of the Great Council
at the next Great Sun Council.</p>

<p>"That Section 1, Article XVII, of the Constitution of Tribes
be amended so as to read as follows: 'No person shall be adopted
into a Tribe of the Order, except a free white male, of good moral
character and standing, and of the full age of eighteen great
suns.'" This matter was discussed at some length, and the Great
Sachem finally ruled that it must lay over one great sun and would
be in order at the next Great Sun Council.</p>

<p>"That the Chiefs of Records of this reservation be more prompt
in forwarding their six moons' reports and per capita tax to the
Great Chief of Records, immediately after the 31st sun, Worm
Moon, and 30th of Corn moon of each six moons." This recommendation
was concurred in by the Great Council.</p>

<p>"That Past Sachems be required to procure and wear regalia
according to their rank as Past Sachems in this Great Council,"
and this recommendation was adopted.</p>

<p>"That the decisions of this Great Council be adopted as a code
and digest for the government of Tribes in this reservation," which
was agreed to.</p>

<p>"As new Tribes, after being instituted, are so often left with
but a faint idea of the workings of the Order, that the Great Sachem,
or some one properly qualified, visit them at least within six
moons after institution, to instruct them in the work, or designate
some Past Sachem for this work when he cannot do it himself."
The recommendation was adopted.</p>

<p>"I recommend that the dispensation issued to Seminole Tribe,
No. 16, be revoked, and that the incoming Great Sachem take
proper steps to receive and recover all books and paraphernalia belonging
to the Tribe, and the same measure in regard to Iroquois
Tribe, No. 12." The subject matter was referred to the incoming
Great Sachem with instructions to endeavor to revive the council
brands before arresting the dispensations.</p>

<p>The following extracts are made from the report of the Great
Chief of Records:</p>

<p>"I am pleased to report that there has been a marked improvement
in the matter of reports from Tribes, yet several of the
reports received are neither complete nor correct. As the Tribes
and chiefs become more accustomed to their duties I believe this
matter will adjust itself. The card catalogue is now nearly complete,
containing the names of members of every Tribe in the
reservation to date except Iroquois, No. 12, and Choctaw, No. 20.
No report has ever been received from No. 12 at Hopkinsville,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
and communications from brothers in those hunting grounds lead
me to believe the Tribe is defunct. I received a report from Seminole
Tribe, No. 16, of Henderson, for the term ending 30th of
Corn Moon last, but no tax, there being none due from them at
that time. Since then I have been unable to get any communication
from their Chief of Records. Otego Tribe, No. 15, of Paducah,
has made no report for the last six moons' term, and repeated
speaking leaves to its C. of R. during the past moon have
elicited no response. I have no other intimation that the Tribe
is not in good condition.</p>

<p>At the last Great Sun Council I was empowered to have the
Great Council incorporated, and the same has been done, and the
articles legally recorded. Herewith I append the incorporation
papers:"</p>

<h3>Articles of Incorporation.</h3>

<p>These Articles of Incorporation, formed and entered into to
incorporate The Great Council of Kentucky of the Improved Order
of Red Men, of the State of Kentucky, an order instituted for the

the general welfare of the members thereof, for the better government
of the Order, and for the more effectual accomplishment
of the charitable objects which are to be furthered by the Order and
this corporation.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;The name of the corporation shall be the Great Council of
Kentucky of the Improved Order of Red Men.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;The object for which this corporation is formed is to perpetuate
the legal existence of the Great Council of Kentucky of
the Improved Order of Red Men, to have a corporation with the
legal capacity to sue and be sued, to contract with and be contracted
with, to pass the necessary laws for the government of the
Tribes belonging to and under the jurisdiction of this Great Council,
to purchase, hold, mortgage and sell real personal property,
to incur debt sufficient to carry out its purposes, and to afford relief
to such of its members as may be in distress, and to accomplish
charitable aims as are consistent with the constitution and
continued existence of the Improved Order of Red Men.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Its principal office shall be located in the city of Lexington,
county of Fayette, State of Kentucky.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;The private property of the members of the corporation
shall not be subject to the debts of the corporation.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;No stock or shares shall be issued, and no dividends or
profits shall be divided.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;The existence of the corporation shall commence from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
signing of these articles and the filing of same in the office of the

<p>The Great Chief of Records, continuing his report, said: "On
the 24th of Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 405, I received the charter
and effects of Tecumseh Tribe, No. 5, of Harrodsburg. At the
last Great Council the Great Chiefs were authorized to borrow five
hundred fathoms. No such loan was ever negotiated, and the G.
C. of R. and the G. K. of W. were left to adjust matters as best
they could. I issued Great Council notes to creditors to the total
amount of $376.50, all of which are now paid, and the Great Council
now has a small balance in its wampum belt, with all debts paid.
Following are the statistics of the Order in this reservation to close
of term ending 31st Worm Moon, G. S. D. 406:</p>

<p>Whole number of members as per last report, 1,142; adopted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
since last report, 468; reinstated, 2; admitted by card, 17; suspended,
204; expelled, 4; withdrawn, 24; deceased, 9; present membership,
1,388; gain, 246; rejected, 17; Past Sachems, 116; Past Great
Sachems, 4; number of Tribes at last report, 11; Tribes instituted,
6; defunct, 1; whole number of Tribes, 16; Tribes making no report,
3; Tribes in good standing, 13; balance in Great Council
Wampum belt, $73.04."</p>

<p>The Board of Appeals reported that they had carefully examined
the appeal of E. G. Van Zandt from the action of Hiawatha
Tribe in expelling him, and sustained the action of the Tribe.
Also in the appeal of J. B. Mendenhall, from the action of Paughcaughnaughsinque
Tribe, No. 6, in expelling him, the committee
made the same finding.</p>

<p>A new law was proposed providing for the consolidation of two
or more Tribes in the same hunting grounds.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee recommended, "That this Great Council
issue mileage vouchers to the Representatives and Great Chiefs
entitle to same, said mileage vouchers to be turned in as per capita
tax by the Tribe of which the brother is a member," which was
agreed to.</p>

<p>The Committee on Charters recommended that charters be issued
to the following Tribes:</p>

<p>Calumet Tribe, No. 18, of Mt. Sterling.</p>

<p>Choctaw Tribe, No. 20, Corbin.</p>

<p>Totewa Tribe, No. 14, Owensboro.</p>

<p>The Great Council then proceeded to the nomination and election
of Great Chiefs, which resulted as follows, and they were
raised with impressive ceremonies at the proper time by Past Great
Sachem Thomas A. Hornsey.</p>

<p>An amendment to the general laws was proposed providing for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
a penalty for Tribes failing to make reports in accordance with
the law.</p>

<p>An amendment to the general laws was proposed to reduce the
per capita tax.</p>

<p>Much time was taken in the discussion of the many decisions
of the Great Sachem, and they were finally adopted with some
changes.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee then made the following report: "We
have carefully examined that portion of Frank L. Smith's report
which properly comes to our committee, and find the same true
and correct&mdash;all vouchers being attached. We find the books and
accounts of this Great Chief in excellent shape and we tender him
our thanks for his help rendered this committee by the simplicity
and fullness of his books and accounts and vouchers. We recommend
the adoption of the Great Chief of Records' report. We have
carefully examined the books and vouchers of the Great Keeper
of Wampum, and find the same correct, and recommend the adoption
of his report with this exception: We advise that the note
dated Jan. 20, 1897, payable to the Elite Stationery Co., for
$135.25, and on which there appears a credit of $85.00, be referred
to the incoming Finance Committee." Action on the foregoing
report was deferred until after the report of the Committee
on State of the Order had been received.</p>

<p>The Committee on State of the Order recommended that the
reports of the Great Chief of Records and the Great Keeper of
Wampum be referred to the incoming Finance Committee for careful
investigation, which was agreed to.</p>

<p>The following resolution was offered, which was made a special
act for the ensuing great sun, to be considered at the next Great
Council as an amendment to the general laws:</p>

<p>Resolved: That the Great Sachem, and he for his Deputy, give
a bond to the amount of $500.00 with three good signatures, for
the faithful performance and settlement of all expenses in organizing
Tribes in this reservation.</p>

<p>An amendment to the constitution governing Tribes was proposed
reducing the minimum age for eligibility to membership to
18 great suns.</p>

<p>The point was raised that at the last Great Council the salary
of the Great Chief of Records was raised to three hundred fathoms,
and that the act was not regular, it requiring an amendment to
the by-laws to apply, and that the resolution would not hold for
the next great sun. The Great Sachem ruled the point well taken,
and on motion it was voted that the salary of the Great Chief of
Records for the ensuing great sun be one hundred fathoms.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>An amendment was offered to increase the salary of the Great
Chief of Records to two hundred fathoms.</p>

<p>A special dispensation was ordered issued to Miami Tribe, No.
17, permitting said Tribe to kindle its council fires once each moon.</p>

<p>A special committee was appointed to formulate a code of laws
to govern the organization of new Tribes.</p>

<p>It was unanimously voted to accept the invitation of Onequa
Tribe, No. 2, of Winchester, to kindle the next Great Sun Council
fire in its wigwam.</p>

<p>A vote of thinks was extended to Osceola Tribe, No. 19, for its
hospitality in entertaining the Great Council.</p>

<p>The special committee on formulation of laws governing organizers
presented a report embracing a code of laws, which was adopted
for the ensuing great sun, to be considered at the next Great
Council as an amendment to the general laws.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem announced the following appointments of
standing committees:</p>

<p>Finance&mdash;Chas. D. Meyer, of No. 8; C. M. Chasteen, of No. 4;
L. E. Pearce, of No. 4.</p>

<p>Law and Usage&mdash;W. C. Pelham, of No. 3; C. E. Lyddane, of
No. 2; O. R. King, of No. 1.</p>

<p>Returns and Reports&mdash;H. C. Rhodes, of No. 7; Willie Walker,
of No. 1; Charles A. Lang, of No. 8.</p>

<p>Board of Appeals&mdash;T. B. Wright, of No. 11; Watt. M. Gay, of
No. 18; Charles A. Lang, of No. 8.</p>

<p>The council fire was then quenched, to be rekindled in the wigwam
of Onequa Tribe, No. 2, hunting grounds of Winchester, at
the 10th run, rising of the 10th sun of Flower Moon, G. S. D. 407.</p>

<h3><b>1898.</b><br /><br />

FOURTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The fourth Great Sun Council fire of the Great Council of
Kentucky was kindled in the wigwam of Onequa Tribe, No. 2,
hunting grounds of Winchester, at the 10th run, rising sun of the
10th sun of Flower Moon, G. S. D. 407, all the elective Great Chiefs
being present. Great Sachem W. E. Fite presided.</p>

<p>The Great Junior Sagamore reported the credentials of the
following named Past Sachems as being correct, and they being in
the forest were introduced and received the Great Council Degree:</p>

<p>Miantonomo, No. 1&mdash;H. A. Daniel.</p>

<p>Onequa, No. 2&mdash;M. E. Pearce, H. Lundberg.</p>

<p>Wyandotte, No. 3&mdash;J. Harry Richardson.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>Winona, No. 4&mdash;F. M. Taylor, J. J. Finigan.</p>

<p>Paughcaughnaughsinque, No. 6&mdash;W. G. Knoedler.</p>

<p>Hiawatha, No. 7&mdash;J. W. Jarboe.</p>

<p>Cherokee, No. 8&mdash;G. W. Hinesley.</p>

<p>Shawnee, No. 9&mdash;B. W. Bierbaum.</p>

<p>Mohican, No. 11&mdash;J. C. Willett</p>

<p>Totewa, No. 14&mdash;Charles Oderman, H. W. Miller.</p>

<p>Calumet, No. 18&mdash;R. A. Chiles.</p>

<p>Osceola, No. 19&mdash;Ed Ballard.</p>

<p>Indianola, No. 21&mdash;W. A. B. McNutt.</p>

<p>Representatives' credentials were recognized from Tribes Nos.
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 18, 13, 21.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem appointed the following committees:</p>

<p>On Charters&mdash;Thos. A. Hornsey, of No. 1; H. V. Cohn, of No.
8; R. W. Jones, of No. 2.</p>

<p>State of the Order&mdash;Frank L. Smith, of No. 1; Ben C. Nunn,
of No. 14; R. Eason, of No. 1.</p>

<p>The minutes of the previous Great Council were approved as
printed.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem in his long talk said: "I have no flattering
report to make; yet I thank the Great Spirit and many loyal brothers
that the Order is in as good condition as it is, for Redmanship
in Kentucky has had a fight for existence, instead of being buoyed
up by the strong hand of co-operation and fraternal love."</p>

<p>He reported that on the 7th of Hunting Moon, 406, he received
the resignation of Frank L. Smith as Great Chief of Records, which
he accepted, and appointed Chas. D. Meyer, of No. 8, to fill out
the unexpired term, and that Bro. Meyer qualified and was raised
on the 11th sleep of Cold Moon in the wigwam of Cherokee Tribe,
No. 8.</p>

<p>"While I have the honor of reporting to you but one new Tribe,
yet I feel that one good Tribe is worth half a dozen that after a
short time become a burden and a worry to the Great Council to keep
them alive. On the sleep of the 9th sun, Buck Moon, G. S.
D. 406, aided by our Great Senior Sagamore, Bro. John I. Winter,
and the degree team of Paughcaughnaughsinque Tribe, No. 6, I
instituted Indianola Tribe, No. 21, at Minerva, with 24 charter
members."</p>

<p>The Great Sachem recounted a list of dispensations granted and
visitations made, showing that he had sat around the council fire
of nearly every Tribe in the reservation.</p>

<p>He made the following recommendations:</p>

<p>That a charter be granted to Indianola Tribe, No. 21, at Minerva.
Agreed to.</p>

<p>That immediate and definite action be taken in regard to Otego
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Tribe, No. 15, at Paducah; Iroquois Tribe, No. 12, at Hopkinsville,
and Seminole Tribe, No. 16, at Henderson, as it is possible
to save one or more of these Tribes if this Great Council sees fit
to take the steps necessary to do so. It was ordered that the incoming
Great Sachem visit these Tribes and endeavor to relight
their council brands, and that an appropriation of 90 fathoms be
made to cover his expenses.</p>

<p>"That this Great Council take such steps as will in the future
prevent the organization of new Tribes and leaving them bankrupt.
Too much attention cannot be given to this." With reference to
this recommendation the Great Council at the proper time passed a
code of laws governing the organization of new Tribes.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee reported as follows:</p>

<p>"We have examined the books and accounts of the Great Chief
of Records, Chas. D. Meyers, and the Great Keeper of Wampum,
John D. Walker, and find the same correct up to date. We recommend
that the Great Chief of Records have a new set of books
gotten up at the expense of the Great Council." They also recommended
the payment of current accounts and mileage of Representatives
and Great Chiefs, all of which was concurred in.</p>

<p>The amendment proposed at the previous Great Council providing
for the giving of a bond by the Great Sachem in the sum of
five hundred fathoms was brought up by the Committee on Law
and Usage and decided to be inexpedient and unnecessary.</p>

<p>Laws governing the organization of new Tribes were adopted,
which are in force at the present time and a part of the general laws.</p>

<p>The Committee on Law and Usage reported favorably on the
following amendment to the general laws, and recommended its
adoption, but the records do not show that any action was ever
taken in the matter: "That the Great Chief of Records shall receive
for his services the sum of two hundred fathoms per great
sun, to be paid monthly."</p>

<p>The Committee on Law and Usage reported adversely on the
proposed amendment to admit pale faces of eighteen great suns of
age, and their recommendation was adopted and the proposed law
defeated.</p>

<p>It was moved and seconded that Councils of the Degree of Pocahontas
be allowed representation in this Great Council, but that
the Representatives must be Past Sachems and pay their own expenses,
but the motion was tabled.</p>

<p>The Great Council was invited to kindle its next Great Sun
Council fire in the hunting grounds of Louisville, and the invitation
was unanimously accepted.</p>

<p>It was moved and seconded that "Our Representatives to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Great Council of the United States be instructed to vote against
any liquor legislation," but the question was laid on the table.</p>

<p>The following amendment to the general laws was proposed to
lay over one Great Sun for action: "Resolved: That the by-laws be
changed by striking out Section 4, Article XX." This would have
the effect of relieving Councils of the Degree of Pocahontas from
paying per capita tax.</p>

<p>An amendment was proposed, to lay over one great sun for
action, providing for the election of Great Chiefs on the second
sun of the great sun session instead of the first.</p>

<p>It was voted that the Great Keeper of Wampum be authorized
to borrow the necessary amount to pay the running expenses for the
ensuing year.</p>

<p>Great Representative Thomas M. Russell, of No. 3, presented
a report, from which we extract the following:</p>

<p>"The question of importance to our Great Council at the late
session of the Great Council of the United States was the action
of the Committee on Appeals in the Van Zandt case, which decision
will be found in the records of the G. C. U. S. of G. S. D. 406,
page 493, in which they sustain Mr. Van Zandt's appeal, giving
as a reason for so doing that he did not receive the notices of the
charges. I personally talked to Brother Gregory, chairman of the
committee, and while he believed that Van Zandt had committed
things unbecoming a Red Man, he said that the law was very plain
and they could not deviate from it."</p>

<p>The following is extracted from the report of the Great Chief
of Records:</p>

<p>Number of members at last report, 1,174. adopted, 76; admitted
by card, 9; reinstated, 23; suspended, 109: withdrawn, 16; expelled,
1; deceased, 3; present membership, 1,209; gain since last report,
38; pale faces rejected, 1; amount in Great Council wampum belt,
$252.42.</p>

<p>Brother C. C. Conley, Great Chief of Records of the Great
Council of the United States, was then introduced and received
with the usual honors. After an appropriate address he proceeded
to raise the elective and appointive Great Chiefs as follows:</p>

hunting grounds of Louisville, at the 10th run, rising of the 9th
sun of Flower Moon, G. S. D. 408.</p>

<h3><b>1899.</b><br /><br />

FIFTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The fifth Great Sun Council fire of the Great Council of Kentucky,
Improved Order of Red Men, was kindled in the wigwam of
Cherokee Tribe, No. 8, in the hunting grounds of Louisville, on
the 9th sun of the Flower Moon, G. S. D. 408.</p>

<p>Representatives were present from Tribes Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7,
8, 9, 11, 14, 18, 19, 21.</p>

<p>Alonzo Walker was appointed official stenographer to report
the proceedings of this Great Council.</p>

<p>The following named Past Sachems were admitted for the first
time:</p>

<p>Hiawatha, No. 7&mdash;S. O. Knoche, W. B. Leatherman, J. W.
Jarbee, M. M. Harbeson.</p>

<p>Cherokee, No. 8&mdash;L. S. Leopold, W. S. Marshall, H. W. Stockhoff,
L. P. Rammers.</p>

<p>Shawnee, No. 9&mdash;J. C. Boardman, H. W. Bohmer, B. W. Bierbaum,
W. M. Evans, G. A. Ellerkamp, E. M. Miller.</p>

<p>Mohican, No. 11&mdash;J. L. Small.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>Totewa, No. 14&mdash;B. Rosenthall, H. W. Miller.</p>

<p>Osceola, No. 19&mdash;C. A. Malone.</p>

<p>The minutes of the previous Great Council were approved as
printed.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem then presented his long talk, in which he
said: "The Great Book says that whom the Great Spirit loves
he chasteneth; the Red Men of Kentucky certainly stand very close
to the big heart of the Great Spirit, having been greatly tried in
the fires of ignorance, stupidity and greed. But, brothers, methinks
I see behind the dark cloud that has long enveloped Kentucky
Redmanship a silver lining, denoting the rising of the sun of prosperity.
I believe the dross has been separated from the gold; I
believe the day is not far distant when I shall see Kentucky Redmanship
where it belongs numerically. To see my beloved Order
on its proper plane in Kentucky will amply repay me for many
weary day's labor in our vineyard."</p>

<p>The Great Sachem then recounted the appointments made and
dispensations granted by him, as well as the decisions he had made,
all of which were referred to the proper committees, as were also
the long talks of the Great Chief of Records and the Great Keeper
of Wampum.</p>

<p>The Committee on Law and Usage reported recommending that
the Great Council concur in and adopt the recommendations of the
Great Sachem, and the report was agreed to.</p>

<p>The amendment to the by-laws proposed at the last session, relieving
Councils of the Degree of Pocahontas from taxation, was
adopted.</p>

<p>The following proposed amendment was the cause of much
discussion, but was finally defeated by a small margin:</p>

<p>"No brother shall be eligible to the Chieftaincy of Great Sachem
unless he has served one term as an elective Chief of a Great
Council; nor to the Chieftaincy of Great Prophet unless he has
served in the Chieftaincy of Great Sachem."</p>

<p>An attempt was made to change the date for kindling the Great
Sun Council fire, but without success.</p>

<p>The incoming Great Sachem was directed to take immediate
steps to close up the affairs of Iroquois, Otego and Seminole Tribes,
they each being reported defunct.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee made its report approving the accounts
of the Great Chief of Records and Great Keeper of Wampum, and
ordered mileage that was to be paid those entitled thereto. The
committee strongly recommended that the Great Sachem visit every
Tribe in the reservation.</p>

<p>Lexington was selected as the next hunting grounds in which
to kindle the Great Sun Council fire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>A rising vote of thanks was extended to Great Chief of Records
Lyddane for having waited until there was sufficient wampum in
the belt before drawing his salary, in order that the per capita tax
might be paid promptly.</p>

<p>The Committee on the State of the Order made its report, in
which it noted the fact that there had been a diminution in the
membership for the past great sun, but that, notwithstanding, the
Order was in a healthy and vigorous condition. It recommended
that the incoming Great Chiefs be more zealous in making official
visitations.</p>

<p>Amendments to the general laws were offered, to lay over one
great sun, to "admit pale faces 18 great suns of age," and also to
grade the representation of Tribes according to their membership.</p>

<p>Bro. H. C. Rhodes, of No. 7, Great Representative to the G. C.
U. S. for two great suns.</p>

<p>Great Keeper of Wampum Walker announced that after all
bills payable at this Great Council had been settled the wampum
belt would be empty, but that there would be no debt.</p>

<p>After the Great Prophet had invoked the Great Spirit, the
council fire was quenched.</p>

<h3>SIXTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.<br /><br />

<b>1900.</b></h3>

<p>A special session of the Great Council was called at Louisville
on the 5th sun of Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 408, and the Council
fire was kindled by special dispensation from the Great Incohonee
in the absence of the Charter of the Great Council. Great Senior
Sagamore Willie Walker presided.</p>

<p>The special session had been called for two purposes. First, to
investigate charges that had been preferred against Great Sachem
W. C. Diederich, accusing him of having conspired with certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
organizers to do illegal acts, and to have otherwise acted in violation
of the law respecting the organization and institution of Tribes.
Second, to adjust a dissention among the chiefs and members of
Hiawatha Tribe.</p>

<p>Representatives were present from Tribes Nos. 1, 4, 7, 8, 9,
and 14.</p>

<p>After due investigation of the charges against Great Sachem
Diederich, it was ordered that they be withdrawn, and the same
being done, Great Sachem Diederich was conducted to his stump
amidst applause.</p>

<p>The commissions of J. B. VanZandt and W. E. Fite as organizers
were revoked.</p>

<p>After a thorough investigation of the affairs of Hiawatha Tribe,
the same were adjusted, and the council fire of this special session
was quenched.</p>

<h3>Regular Session.</h3>

<p>The sixth Great Sun Council Fire was kindled in the Hunting
Grounds of Lexington, at the 10th run, rising of the 8th Sun of
Flower Moon, G. S. D. 409.</p>

<p>All Great Chiefs were present and the representatives of 27
Tribes. The gross attendance was 95 Past Sachems.</p>

<p>Great Sachem W. C. Diederich then read his long talk, in which
he said, "I entered upon the duties of the office with a firm determination
to devote my best endeavor to the upbuilding of our
beloved Order in the Great Reservation. Finding I had not much
time to devote to the upbuilding of our Order, I had the pleasure
of appointing Brother John B. VanZandt as my Organizer, and the
progress he has made will be seen in his report. I have, during
my term, had some unpleasantness. It has not all been smooth
sailing, but now peace and harmony reign once more. I have tried
to fulfil my obligations to the best of my ability and the Great
Spirit has safely guided me through."</p>

<p>The Great Sachem reported having visited nearly every Tribe in
the reservation, the institution of a number of new tribes, a few
dispensations granted and decisions made.</p>

<p>The State Organizer, J. B. VanZandt reported the institution
of 19 new tribes, as follows:&mdash;Hiokatoo, No. 5, Louisville; Wahoo,
No. 10, Louisville; Wabee, No. 13, Louisville; Choctaw. No. 15,
Louisville; Montezuma. No. 16, Louisville; Tecumseh, No. 12,
Louisville; Mohawk, No. 20, Louisville; Chippewa, No. 22, Louisville;
Delaware, No. 23, Lebanon; Black Hawk, No. 24, Springfield;
Matamora, No. 25, St. Matthews; Wyoming, No. 26, Danville;
Seneca, No. 27, Stanford; Dakota, No. 28, Junction City; Onondaga,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
No. 30, Lancaster; Manitou, No. 31, Eminence; Iroquois,
No. 32, Pittsburg; Massasoit, No. 33, LaGrange; Montauk, No.
35, East Bernstadt.</p>

<p>Great Chief of Records C. E. Lyddane in his long talk said:&mdash;"In
no other reservation has Redmanship increased to such an
extent during the past great sun as in Kentucky. Council Fires
have been kindled in the metropolis, in the country towns and in
the mining villages." From his report is gleaned the following:
Number of members adopted, 1015; reinstated, 29; Admitted by
card, 10; suspended, 176; withdrawn, 34; expelled, 3; deceased,
9; present membership, 2018; number of working tribes, 36;
amount disbursed by tribes for relief, $1,525.36; for funeral
benefits, $343.00; for other purposes, $7,386.80; total worth of
tribes, $9,247.06.</p>

<p>The Great Council then went into the election for Great Chiefs.</p>

<p>W. C. Diederich, of No. 19, was elected Great Prophet, there
being no other nominations.</p>

<p>Willie Walker, of No. 1 was elected Great Sachem, no others
being nominated.</p>

<p>G. A. Ellerkamp, of No. 9 was elected Great Senior Sagamore,
with no other nominations.</p>

<p>W. C. Pelham, of No. 3 was elected Great Junior Sagamore,
with O. R. King, of No. 1, S. C. Moore of No. 7 and John Ropke,
of No. 8 also in nomination.</p>

<p>C. E. Lyddane, of No. 2 was elected Great Chief of Records
without opposition.</p>

<p>John D. Walker, of No. 4 was elected Great Keeper of Wampum
by acclamation.</p>

<p>Louis Vissman, of No. 9 was elected Great Representative to the
Great Council of the United States for two great suns, E. E. Bennett,
of No. 11 and J. R. McConnell, of No. 1 being also in nomination.</p>

<p>Danville was selected as the place for the kindling of the next
council fire, Maysville and Owensboro being also in nomination.</p>

<p>A resolution was introduced and adopted to elect a General State
Organizer.</p>

<p>After one of the most spirited races of the session, John Hafendorfer,
of No. 14, was elected over J. B. VanZandt, of No. 9.</p>

<p>This was the first time an official Organizer had been selected by
the Great Council, heretofore it having been considered entirely
within the power of the Great Sachem to regulate the matter to
suit himself, the theory being that the Great Sachem was the
official Organizer, and it was his privilege to appoint such deputies
as he thought proper.</p>

<p>An amendment to the laws was adopted permitting membership
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
of palefaces 18 great suns of age, with the proviso that such applications
should bear the endorsement of parent or guardian.</p>

<p>A resolution was offered providing for representation of tribes
in the Great Council according to membership, but the matter was
laid on the table.</p>

<p>Charters were ordered issued to all Tribes instituted during the
previous great sun.</p>

<p>On the recommendation of the Committee on Returns and Reports
it was ordered that in the future the organizer of a new
Tribe shall file a written report of its institution within one moon
thereafter.</p>

<p>On the recommendation of the Committee on the State of the
Order it was ordered that no "Supervisory District Deputy Great
Sachems having authority over tribal Deputies be appointed."</p>

<p>The following resolution was unanimously adopted:&mdash;"The roll
of Great Chiefs and Representatives shall be called at the close of
each sun's session and no brother shall be entitled to mileage unless
he shall answer thereto."</p>

<p>It was also ordered that the Great Sachem be required to visit
every Tribe in the Reservation at least once during his term, and
the finance committee was directed to set aside an amount sufficient
to cover expenses incurred. This would be quite an expensive
matter if followed in the present day, and the Great Sachem's
term would have to be extended to cover more than one sun or
it would be impossible for him to comply with the law.</p>

<p>Past Sachem Frank L. Smith was allowed a small fee for his
services as Assistant Great Chief of Records, being the first recognition
of such a sub-chieftaincy.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem ruled that representatives of Tribes not having
been instituted two moons and not having paid tax were not entitled
to mileage. The fiscal great sun at that time ended the
30th of Worm Moon, and the Great Sun Council was held then as
now the second Tuesday in Flower Moon, and but few tribes were
thus deprived of mileage for their representatives.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee recommended the allowance of mileage
to 38 Great Chiefs and Representatives, amounting to $161.70, an
average of $5.22 to each.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem's expense account of $97.37 for the great sun
was allowed.</p>

<p>A controversy between Tippecanoe Tribe, No. 29 and Hiawatha
Tribe, No. 7, regarding a claim of the latter against the former
that certain Hiawatha members had taken membership in Tippecanoe
without leave or license was adjusted by ordering that such
members take cards from Hiawatha Tribe. It would seem that
the matter should have been settled in a different manner, as it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
not possible for dual membership to exist, and the brothers in
question were members of either one tribe or another, and as
membership of a Red Man in another Tribe is impossible without
the depositing of a card, it should have been ruled that the brothers
were still members of Hiawatha Tribe and subject to its laws in
every respect.</p>

<p>Past Great Sachem J. R. McConnell raised the following named
Great Chiefs:&mdash;</p>

<p>Past Great Sachem McConnell appointed Thos. M. Russell and
Henry W. Ray, of No. 3, to raise the Great Junior Sagamore
elect, W. C. Pelham, to his stump in the council chamber of his
Tribe.</p>

<p>Former organizer J. B. VanZandt presented petitions for charters
for Irondequoit Tribe, No. 38, at Hardinsburg and Choctaw
Tribe, No. 39 at Bardstown, and it was ordered that charters be
granted the tribes as soon as instituted.</p>

<p>Great Sachem Walker announced the appointment of the following

<p>After thanks had been given to Miantonomo Tribe for its courteous
entertainment of the Great Council, and to Past Great
Sachem Diederich for his services as Great Sachem, the Great
Prophet said a prayer, and the Council Fire was quenched.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<h3>SEVENTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.<br /><br />

<b>1901.</b></h3>

<p>Prior to the kindling of the council fire, the Great Council was
called to order at the Opera House by Past Sachem V. Freeman,
chairman of the local committee, and after an invocation by the
Rev. J. O. Vaught, in a few well chosen remarks he introduced
the Hon. William Jennings Price, who delivered an address of
welcome, which was a beautiful word picture. This was appropriately
responded to by Great Sachem Willie Walker, after which
the guests were dismissed and the Seventh Great Sun Council
Fire of the Great Council of Kentucky was kindled in the Wigwam
of Wyoming Tribe, No. 26, Hunting Grounds of Danville.</p>

<p>All of the Great Chiefs were present and twenty-six Past Sachems.
Frank L. Smith was appointed Assistant Great Chief of
Records.</p>

<p>The Great Council Degree was conferred upon forty-one Past
Sachems in waiting, and thus the total attendance at the session
was 78.</p>

<p>Representatives were present from 42 Tribes and but two were
unrepresented.</p>

<p>Great Sachem Willie Walker, in his long talk said&mdash;"The past
great sun has wrought most magnificent results and shows what
human desire and harmonious action can accomplish. Where the
banner of thirty-six Tribes and one council of the Degree of
Pocahontas hung in the breeze, there now triumphantly floats,
kissed by the winds of heaven, thirty-one additional emblems, and
one of the Degree of Pocahontas." He may well have been proud
of his record, for not until five great suns had passed was it even
equaled. He also said&mdash;"One of the most exalted things a man
can do is to succor the distressed, feed the hungry and clothe the
poor, and especially to care for the widows and orphans. We
should by all means begin a fund for the establishment of a Widows'
and orphans' Home for our Order. I suggest that a committee
of five be appointed to formulate a plan by which we can
establish this fund and that they report at this Council." This
was the first mention in the Great Council of Kentucky of this
subject, soon destined to be one of the most important objects of
legislation, and Great Sachem Walker has the credit of its inception.</p>

<p>After having made several other important recommendations,
given a list of his appointments of Deputies, a digest of decisions
and opinions rendered, he closes with a glowing tribute to deceased
Past Sachems John R. Shely, of No. 1; R. W. Jones, of No.
2 and Joe Gast, of No. 18.</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records Lyddane reported as follows:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>Adopted since last report, 1564; reinstated, 38; admitted by
card, 23; suspended, 266; withdrawn, 69; expelled, 22; deceased,
28; present membership, 3,196. Disbursed by Tribes for
relief, $3,921.43; for burial of the dead, $1,065.00; for other purposes,
$15,025.86; total worth of tribes, $13,478.09.</p>

<p>Great Keeper of Wampum John D. Walker reported there being
$1,851.64 in the Great Council wampum belt.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem made appointments on the standing Committees
as follows, to fill vacancies:&mdash;</p>

<p>Finance&mdash;W. S. Cramer, of No. 1; Lawrence Leopold, of No. 8;
L. Vissman, of No. 9.</p>

<p>Law and Usage&mdash;D. N. Zimmerman, of No. 4.</p>

<p>Appeals&mdash;H. S. Chase, of No. 28.</p>

<p>State of the Order&mdash;Henry Schwieters, of No. 8; J. R. McConnell,
of No. 1; Jas. R. W. Smith, of No. 63.</p>

<p>Charters&mdash;R. F. Arnett, of No. 1; L. W. Zweydorf, of No. 7;
S. T. Noe, of No. 24.</p>

<p>The following named Great Chiefs were elected for the ensuing
great sun:&mdash;</p>

<p>Willie Walker, of No. 1 was elected Great Prophet without opposition.</p>

<p>Gustav A. Ellerkamp, of No. 9, was elected Great Sachem, there
being no other nominations.</p>

<p>W. C. Pelham, of No. 3 was unanimously elected Great Senior
Sagamore.</p>

<p>H. J. McFarlan, of No. 33, was elected Great Junior Sagamore,
other candidates being E. B. Ryan, of No. 4; Lee W. Zweydorf,
of No. 7; O. R. King, of No. 1.</p>

<p>C. E. Lyddane, of No. 2 was re-elected Great Chief of Records
without opposition.</p>

<p>John D. Walker, of No. 4 was unanimously re-elected Great Keeper
of Wampum.</p>

<p>Willie Walker, of No. 1, Lawrence S. Leopold, of No. 8 and John
Hafendorfer, of No. 14 were elected Great Representatives to the
Great Council of the United States.</p>

<p>It developed later that Kentucky was entitled to only two of the
three Great Representatives elected, and thus credentials were not
issued to Past Sachem Hafendorfer, he being the last to be elected.</p>

<p>F. W. Jones was unanimously elected State Organizer.</p>

<p>Owensboro was selected as the next place for kindling the Great
Council Fire, in the Wigwam of Totewa Tribe, No. 14.</p>

<p>Great Sachem Willie Walker announced that contributions had
been received from Kentucky Tribes for the relief of the sufferers
from the Galveston flood amounting to $242.50, which had been
forwarded to the Relief Committee.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p>The Committee on Law and Usage recommended that there be
some means adopted to bring about more uniformity in Tribal by-laws,
and suggested that a model code be prepared as a guide to
new tribes especially.</p>

<p>A resolution to amend the laws so as to allow Tribes representation
according to membership was defeated.</p>

<p>Great Mishinewa Wm. A. Crader, for the special Committee appointed
at the last Great Council to adjust the differences between
Tecumseh Tribe, No. 29 and Hiawatha Tribe, No. 7 reported that
the matter had been amicably settled.</p>

<p>Past Sachem John Hafendorfer, who had been elected State Organizer
at the previous Great Sun Council presented a report, in
which he stated he had appointed F. W. Jones as Chief Deputy
Organizer, and that credit was due to Bro. Jones for the work that
had been accomplished, thirty-one new Tribes having been instituted.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee reported having found the books and
accounts of the Great Chief of Records and Great Keeper of Wampum
correct, and made the following recommendations, all of
which were concurred:&mdash;</p>

<p>That fifty fathoms be appropriated for the relief of the Galveston
flood sufferers.</p>

<p>That mileage be allowed all members of Standing Committees.
This was the first time members of the Standing Committees had
been paid.</p>

<p>That the Great Sachem be authorized to appoint a State Exemplifier,
and that $500.00 be appropriated for the use of the Great
Sachem and the Exemplifier. The Great Sachem appointed Past
Sachem Frank L. Smith, of No. 1 to this position, which he has
held by re-appointment each Great Sun to the present time, 1908.</p>

<p>That a special Committee of three Past Sachems be appointed
to investigate the matter of a Widows' and Orphans' Fund and report
at the next Great Council. The Great Sachem appointed on
this Committee, O. R. King, of No. 1; W. M. Evans, of No. 9; and
H. V. Cohn, of No. 8, together with the incoming Great Sachem,
ex-officio.</p>

<p>The Committee on Charters recommended that charters be issued
to the following named tribes, they having been instituted
during the past Great Sun: Cataraugus, No. 36, Livingston; Red
Hawk, No. 40, Falmouth; Shabbona, No. 46; Somerset; Oconee,
No. 47, Bloomfield; King Phillip, No. 48, Hustonville; Shingawassa,

No. 65, Paris; Sagamore, No. 66, Hickman; Black Foot, No. 67,
Frankfort. Juanita Council, No. 3, D. of P., Louisville. No charter
was issued to Minetonka Tribe, No. 49, it being reported defunct.</p>

<p>It was reported that Shawnee Tribe, No. 9 and Tecumseh Tribe,
No. 12, both of Louisville, had consolidated, and it was ordered
that a charter be issued to the new Tribe as Tecumseh Tribe No. 9.</p>

<p>A resolution to establish the minimum fee for adoption and degrees
at ten farthoms ($10.00) was defeated.</p>

<p>Upon the recommendation of the Finance Committee, mileage
was allowed to Great Chiefs, representatives and members of standing
committees, sixty in number, amounting to $473.50, being an
average of $7.89 per capita.</p>

<p>An amendment to the general laws fixing the minimum fee for
adoption at eight fathoms was presented to be considered at the
next Great Council.</p>

<p>The contract for printing proceedings was awarded to A. J.
Domeck, of Louisville, at 75 cents per page.</p>

<p>An amendment to the general laws providing for the election of
Great Chiefs by the "Australian Ballot", all Past Sachems to participate,
the election to take place in the wigwams of the various
Tribes was presented to lay over one Great Sun. This proposed
law was styled by its opponents the "Goebel" law of Redmanship.</p>

<p>It was ordered that portraits of all deceased Past Sachems, members
of this Great Council, be printed in the records, together with
a memorial.</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records was instructed to prepare a roster
of all members of the Great Council, to be kept in a book provided
for that purpose, and to have it present at each Great Council.</p>

<p>It was the sense of the Great Council that the Great Council of
the United States be invited to kindle its next Great Sun Council
Fire in the Reservation of Kentucky.</p>

<p>Past Great Sachem J. R. McConnell raised the Great Chiefs

Great Council, the council fire was quenched.</p>

<h3>EIGHTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.<br /><br />

<b>1902.</b></h3>

<p>This Council Fire was kindled in the wigwam of Totewa Tribe,
No. 14, Hunting Grounds of Owensboro, at the tenth run, 45th
breath, rising of the 13th sun of Flower Moon, G. S. D. 411. All
of the elective Great Chiefs were present.</p>

<p>Previous to the kindling of the Council Fire welcoming exercises
were held in the Court House, where Past Sachem S. W.
Bedford, of No. 14, as chairman, introduced Mayor Yewell and Bro.
LaVega Clement, who delivered addresses of welcome responded to
by Great Sachem Ellerkamp, when the meeting adjourned to the
council chamber of Totewa Tribe.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem stated that he had been requested to appoint
a Chief's Degree member of No. 14 as official stenographer of the
Great Council, but the brother not being a Past Sachem, he
could not be admitted. A motion being made that the Great Council
Degree be conferred upon the Brother in question, the Great
Sachem ruled the matter out of order.</p>

<p>It was then ordered that the Great Council go into the nomination
and election of an Assistant Great Chief of Records. Prior
to this session, the Assistant to the Great Chief of Records had been
appointed by that Great Chief.</p>

<p>Frank L. Smith, of No. 1 and J. G. Sewell, of No. 7 were placed
in nomination, but Past Sachem Sewell declining to serve if elected,
the remaining candidate was elected by acclamation.</p>

<p>The following were appointed a Credential Committee&mdash;Great
Junior Sagamore H. J. McFarlan, assisted by Con Trouth, of No.
7; H. H. Denhardt, of No. 11, and C. M. Chasteen, of No. 4.
This Committee reported recommending the admission of 47 Past
Sachems in waiting, and the recognition of the representatives of
37 Tribes. The total attendance at this Great Council was 101.</p>

<p>From the Great Sachem's Long Talk, the following is quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To my regret I am compelled to say, that the growth of the
Order is not as phenomenal as that of the two previous great suns
when a gain of 1500 members was made, but still I am proud to
state that, what a few moons ago seemed a probable loss in membership
is reverted into a gain, and where the membership one year
ago was 3269 we now have 3525 members. Since last Great Council
Delaware Tribe, No. 23, at Lebanon, Ononga Tribe, No. 34 at
Covington, Red Hawk No. 40 at Somerset, Tawawa, No. 52 at Vine
Grove, Sagwa, No. 59, at Lawrenceburg, Wichita, No. 61, at Mayfield,
Waukee, No. 62 at Fulton, and Black Hawk, No. 24, at
Springfield have become defunct. After due investigation to ascertain
the cause of so many Tribes quenching their council fires,
I find that the most of the trouble can be found in the following
three causes: First, lack of proper instruction; Second, the organizer
did not exercise enough care when soliciting charter members
for new tribes, placing therein members objectionable to a
majority; Third, Tribes numerically and financially weak would
overreach themselves in the matter of buying paraphernalia, then
finding themselves involved would attempt to give a pow-wow, and
instead of bettering themselves would plunge deeper in debt and
dissolution would follow. To the credit of Bro. F. W. Jones it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
must be said that he exercised splendid judgement as to the character
of the charter members of the tribes he instituted during the
past great sun."</p>

<p>The Great Sachem enumerates his visitations, appointments of
Deputies, and decisions rendered. From the recommendations
offered by that Great Chief we quote the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Articles of Incorporation need to be revised and I would
urge immediate attention to this matter.</p>

<p>The minimum fee for the three degrees should be placed at
ten fathoms.</p>

<p>The fee for adoption in Councils of the Degree of Pocahontas
should be fixed. The laws are at present vague.</p>

<p>The Great Council should empower the Great Sachem to appoint
an instructor or Exemplifier, and fix his compensation. A
little wampum invested in this manner will materially enlighten
and strengthen weak and tottering Tribes."</p>

<p>The Great Sachem recounted the memorial services held by the
Louisville Tribes on the death by assassination of President
Wm. McKinley, and paid tribute also to the memory of Past
Sachems Wm. A. Metcalf, of No. 1 and Thos. Wendroth, of No.
17, who had passed to the great beyond since last Great Council.</p>

<p>The institution of fifteen new Tribes by State Organizer F. W.
Jones is recounted, and also of two Councils of the Degree of
Pocahontas.</p>

<p>The following consolidations are recorded:</p>

<p>Minewa, No. 53, of Beaver Dam with Kentucky, No. 54, of
McHenry, the council fire of the former being quenched forever.</p>

<p>Pequod, No. 63, with Hiawatha, No. 7, both of Louisville, the
Council fire of No. 63 being quenched forever.</p>

<p>Red Jacket, No. 44, with Hiawatha, No. 7, both of Louisville,
quenching forever the council fire of Red Jacket, No. 44.</p>

<p>Tippecanoe, No. 29, with Cherokee, No. 8, both of Louisville,
the former going of existence.</p>

<p>Tecumseh No. 9, which had already absorbed Shawnee No. 9 and
Tecumseh No. 12, with Cherokee, No. 8, the former quenching its
council fire forever.</p>

<p>An extended review is made of the efficient work done by Special
Deputy Great Sachem Wm. A. Crader in visiting weak and defunct
Tribes, endeavoring to revive where possible, and where not possible
closing the Tribes by quenching their council fires forever.</p>

<p>The following were appointed to fill vacancies in Standing Committees:&mdash;</p>

<p>State of the Order&mdash;Ben C. Nunn, of No. 14; Edw. L. David,
of No. 5.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>Great Keeper of Wampum John D. Walker made his report
showing balance in wampum belt of $2,537.37.</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records presented his Long Talk, from which
we make the following extracts: Members adopted since last report,
1221; admitted by card, 110; reinstated, 35; suspended, 513;
expelled, 2; withdrawn, 55; deceased, 25; disbursed by Tribes for</p>

<p>relief, $5,247.45; for burial of the dead, $1,050.00; for other purposes,
$17,152.19; amount invested by Tribes, $7,742.08; total
worth of Tribes, $17,079.23.</p>

<p>The election of Great Chiefs was then entered into, with the
following results:&mdash;</p>

<p>Gustav A. Ellerkamp was unanimously elected Great Prophet.</p>

<p>W. C. Pelham, of No. 3, being the only nominee for Great Sachem
was elected by acclamation.</p>

<p>Horace J. McFarlan, of No. 33, was elected Great Senior Sagamore
without opposition.</p>

<p>H. H. Denhardt, of No. 11, was elected Great Junior Sagamore
on the third ballot, other candidates being W. A. Crader, of No.
8, L. L. Bebout, of No. 60, and O. R. King, of No. 1.</p>

<p>C. E. Lyddane, of No. 2, being the only candidate, was unanimously
elected Great Chief of Records.</p>

<p>S. C. Moore, of No. 7 was elected Great Keeper of Wampum,
there being no other nominee. John D. Walker, the former encumbent
having served five great suns successively was given the
honors of a Past Great Sachem, and he declined to be a candidate
for re-election.</p>

<p>Past Great Sachems G. A. Ellerkamp and John D. Walker
were elected Great Representatives for two great suns each. Other
candidates in nomination being F. W. Jones, of No. 14 and John
Hafendorfer, of No. 14.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem announced the following appointments to fill
vacancies on Committees:&mdash;</p>

<p>Appeals&mdash;J. M. Clifford, of No. 10; Ben H. Schrader, of No.
5; W. B. Eason, of No. 1.</p>

<p>Charters&mdash;J. G. Sewell, of No. 7; C. A. Woolfolk, of No. 7;
L. L. Bebout, of No. 60.</p>

<p>It was ordered that the matter of organization of new Tribes
for the ensuing Great Sun be left in the hands of the Great Sachem,
he to appoint such organizer or organizers as he might deem for
the best interests of the Order.</p>

<p>Maysville was unanimously selected as the place for kindling
the next Great Sun Council Fire.</p>

<p>The special Committee appointed at the last Great Sun Council
to present a plan for the establishment of a Widows' and Orphans'
Fund presented a report embodying the text of a law and recommended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
its adoption, but its consideration was deferred one great
sun that the matter might be referred back to the tribes for thorough
discussion therein. The bill, as recommended by this Committee
was adopted four great suns later with some slight modifications.</p>

<p>The Committee on Law and Usage reported having prepared a
model code of by-laws for the use of Tribes, and they having been
promulgated by the Great Sachem were already in use by many
Tribes.</p>

<p>A law was enacted establishing the minimum fee for adoption
at eight fathoms, it formerly being three fathoms.</p>

<p>An amendment to the law was adopted requiring organizers to
submit a list of all candidates for charter membership to all tribes
in the same hunting grounds.</p>

<p>The Great Representatives to the Great Council of the United
States made a written report, which was the first time this had
been done.</p>

<p>State Organizer Jones reported having instituted fourteen new
Tribes, and gave data in regard to each.</p>

<p>It was ordered that the Great Representatives invite the Great
Council of the United States to kindle its Great Sun Council Fire
in 412 in the hunting grounds of Louisville.</p>

<p>The bill proposed at the previous Great Sun Council, providing
for the election of Great Chiefs in the Council Chambers of Tribes,
by the "Australian" ballot, was reported on adversely by the Committee
on Law and Usage, and thus the so-called "Goebel" bill
was defeated.</p>

<p>On the recommendation of the Committee on Laws and Usage,
it was ordered by the Great Council that Tribes must pay benefits
to a disabled brother as long as his disability should continue. It
had been the custom of Tribes to provide by a by-law to that effect
that benefits should cease after a stated period. The ruling
also provided that the minimum amount of benefits to be paid
should be a sum equal to the dues of the brother that might accrue
during his disability, or in other words, enough to keep the brother
in good standing. Later the Great Council of the United States
fixed the minimum amount at one fathom per seven suns.</p>

<p>A resolution was adopted requiring the financial Great Chiefs
to give bond in an indemnity bonding company, and that the Great
Keeper of Wampum should be paid a salary of fifty fathoms per
Great Sun.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee, among other recommendations offered
the following which were agreed to:&mdash;</p>

<p>That the Assistant Great Chief of Records be allowed fifty
fathoms for his services.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>That the printing for the ensuing Great Sun be awarded to the
"American Red Man" at 95 cents per page.</p>

<p>That five hundred fathoms be appropriated for the use of the
Great Sachem for the best interests of the Order.</p>

<p>The minimum fee for adoption in Councils of the Degree of
Pocahontas was fixed at one fathom.</p>

<p>Charters were granted the following new Tribes:&mdash;Otawa, No.
68, Olive Hill; Powhatan, No. 69, Carrollton; Sioux, No. 70,
Louisville; Little Ha Ha, No. 71, Owenton; Morning Star, No.
72, Fordsville; Warsaw, No. 73, Rockport; Floating Canoe, No.
76, Richmond; Shawnee, No. 77, Georgetown; Grand Glaze, No.
79, Monterey; Ptocawa, No. 80, Louisville; Yosemite, No. 81,
Louisville; Appalachia, No. 82, Pineville; Passyunk, No. 83, Harrodsburg;
Spotted Wolf, No. 84, Coalton; Red Cloud, No. 85,
Warsaw; Big Eagle, No. 86, Sanders; Alfaretta Council, No. 4,
Louisville; Prairie Flower, No. 5, Newport.</p>

<p>On the recommendation of the Finance Committee mileage was
allowed the Great Chiefs, Representatives, and Members of Standing
Committees, amounting to $610.47, being paid to 68 individuals,
an average of $8.97 per capita.</p>

<p>An amendment was proposed to be considered at the next Great
Sun Council advancing the minimum fee for adoption to fifteen
fathoms.</p>

<p>A resolution was adopted instructing the Great Representatives
to endeavor to have a change made in the grip.</p>

<p>An emblematic Tomahawk was ordered presented to Totewa
Tribe, No. 14, in commemoration of the present session of the
Great Council in its wigwam.</p>

<p>It was ordered that a committee of two be appointed to prepare
new Articles of Incorporation, and the Great Sachem appointed
Lawrence S. Leopold, of No. 8, and H. J. McFarlan, of No. 33.</p>

<p>Great Representative Lawrence Leopold presented a ring to Great
Sachem Ellerkamp in behalf of the Past Sachem's Association of
Louisville.</p>

<p>Past Great Sachem W. C. Diederich, senior Past Great Sachem
present raised the Great Chiefs elect as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption">GREAT COUNCIL OF KENTUCKY&mdash;EIGHTH SESSION, OWENSBORO, MAY 13-14, 1902.</p>
</div>

<p>The Great Sachem announced the following as members of Standing
Committees for the ensuing great sun:&mdash;</p>

<p>Finance&mdash;Henry W. Ray, of No. 3; O. R. King, of No. 1; W.
M. Evans, of No. 8.</p>

<p>Law and Usage&mdash;Frank L. Smith, of No. 1; W. A. Crader, of
No. 8; Geo. C. Wolf, of No. 77.</p>

<p>Returns and Reports&mdash;Robert Lee Page, of No. 80; N. G.
Mothershead, of No. 57; Forsee D. Lee, of No. 71.</p>

<p>Appeals&mdash;Louis Vissman, of No. 8; C. H. Bateman, of No. 50;
Sebastian Stone, of No. 56.</p>

<p>State of the Order&mdash;L. L. Bebout, of No. 60; J. H. Kemper,
of No. 18; L. E. Herrell, of No. 54.</p>

<p>After Past Sachem Frank L. Smith, of No. 1 had exemplified
the unwritten work of the Order, the Council Fire was quenched
to be rekindled in the wigwam of Wyandotte Tribe, No. 3, hunting
grounds of Maysville, G. S. D. 412.</p>

<h3><b>1903.</b><br /><br />

NINTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>Previous to the kindling of the council fire an excellent program
of welcome was rendered, including musical selections by the Red
Men's Band, and addresses by Past Great Sachem John I. Winter,
Past Great Incohonee Thomas K. Donnalley, of Pennsylvania, and
Great Sachem Pelham.</p>

<p>At the 10th run, rising of the 12th sun of Flower Moon, G.
S. D. 412, the ninth Great sun council fire was kindled in ample
form, all elective and appointed Great Chiefs being present, as
well as 78 Past Sachems.</p>

<p>D. N. Zimmerman, of No. 4 and Thomas M. Russell, of No.
3, were appointed to assist Great Junior Sagamore Denhardt in the
examination of credentials, which committee soon reported the
presence of fifty-six Past Sachems in the forest for the first time,
and they were admitted to seats in the Great Council, making the
total attendance 134.</p>

<p>The roll call of representatives disclosed the presence of the
representatives of fifty-seven Tribes out of sixty-three.</p>

<p>An election for Assistant Great Chief of Records was then entered
into, and Past Sachem Frank L. Smith was chosen, the
opposing candidate being P. P. Doll, of No. 8.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>Great Sachem Pelham presented his long talk in print, the
first time it had been done, which met with the approval of all.</p>

<p>The following quotations are from that document:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am proud to say the condition of the Order in this Reservation
is prosperous and progressive. Probably fifteen hundred names
have been added to the roster of membership during the past great
sun, and with few exceptions the Tribes and Councils are on the
hunt for palefaces with that enthusiasm and energy that knows
no such word as fail."</p>

<p>In regard to Councils of the Degree of Pocahontas he said:&mdash;"This
branch of the Order appears to have been almost entirely
neglected by former Great Councils of this Reservation. The tax
formerly assessed against members of Councils was repealed by this
Great Council at its fifth session, and I find no mention of them
in the Records since.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that the Tribe and Council are each
benefited by the presence of the other, and the membership of
both are alike interested in the upbuilding of their local branches
and in the advancement of the interests of the Order generally.</p>

<p>Under the care of this Great Council are five Councils who
are entirely at sea in the matter of laws for their government; and
it would surely be wise in this body to formulate a code for their
benefit.</p>

<p>Diligent inquiry failing to furnish me with the name of any
person who would undertake the business of organizing Tribes in
this Reservation, I therefore tried to find some one in each locality
who would undertake to organize a Tribe nearby. As a direct
result, ten new Tribes were instituted, the organizers being in each
case persons living in the near locality of the new Tribes."</p>

<p>The method thus inaugurated by Great Sachem Pelham has
been pursued by his successors to the present, with results never
equaled by any Reservation in the history of the Order.</p>

<p>As usual he recounts the dispensations granted, decisions made,
and announces the inauguration by the Great Council of the United
States of the Orphan's Guardian Fund.</p>

<p>"I appointed Past Sachem Frank L. Smith Exemplifier for the
Reservation at large, and sent him on an extended trail, and he
visited and exemplified the work to forty-one tribes in two moons.
It is to be regretted that the amount of the appropriation for this
purpose would not permit the visitation of every Tribe in the
Reservation. That the visits and instructions were highly appreciated
is attested by numerous letters from the Tribes, and they
clearly remonstrate the great importance of following up the institution
of a Tribe by proper instruction and encouragement,
either by a neighboring Tribe or by a Great Chief or Exemplifier."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>He reported the following tribes as being defunct:&mdash;Delaware,
No. 23, Lebanon; Seneca, No. 27, Stanford; Narragansett, No.
43, Middlesboro; Shabbona, No. 46, Somerset; Sagamore, No. 66,
Hickman; Nokomis, No. 74, Franklin.</p>

<p>Among the recommendations offered were the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That a code of laws be prepared for the government of Councils
of the Degree of Pocahontas of this Reservation."</p>

<p>"That the horse be adopted as the Totem of this Reservation
as recommended by our Great Representatives at Norfolk last Corn
Moon."</p>

<p>The following appointments were made to fill vacancies:&mdash;</p>

<p>On Laws and Usage&mdash;C. P. Harding, of No. 5.</p>

<p>On State of the Order&mdash;Thos. O. Long, of No. 57.</p>

<p>On Charters&mdash;John H. Ropke, of No. 8; Chas. Wheeler, of No.
48; G. W. Griffith, of No. 11.</p>

<p>The Great Council then went into the election of Great Chiefs.</p>

<p>Horace J. McFarlan, of No. 33, was elected Great Sachem by
acclamation.</p>

<p>H. H. Denhardt, of No. 11 was elected Great Senior Sagamore
without opposition.</p>

<p>Lewis L. Bebout, of No. 60 was elected Great Junior Sagamore
on the second ballot, O. R. King, of No. 1, L. D. Owen, of No. 8,
and D. H. Russell, of No. 10 being also in nomination.</p>

<p>Henry W. Ray, of No. 3 was unanimously elected Great Chief
of Records, Henry Schwieters, of No. 8 being also nominated but
declined to make the race. C. E. Lyddane, who had held the
chieftaincy for five consecutive great suns was not a candidate for
re-election, and he was awarded the honors of a Past Great Sachem.</p>

<p>S. C. Moore, of No. 7 was re-elected Great Keeper of Wampum
without opposition.</p>

<p>W. C. Pelham, of No. 3, Chas. A. Hess, of No. 10 and John H.
Buschemeyer, of No. 8 were elected Great Representatives for two
Great Suns each, other candidates in nomination being Lawrence
S. Leopold, of No. 8; W. C. Diederich, of No. 19; Willie Walker,
of No. 1; J. Robin Garr, of No. 7; John H. Ropke, of No. 8.</p>

<p>Great Keeper of Wampum S. C. Moore reported balance in
the Great Council wampum belt as being $2,853.10.</p>

<p>It was agreed by unanimous vote to kindle the next Great Sun
Council fire in the wigwam of Otego Tribe, No. 60, hunting grounds
of Paducah.</p>

<p>An amendment to the laws was adopted fixing the minimum
fee for adoption at four fathoms. It had been fixed at eight fathoms
by the previous Great Council, and it was proposed at this time to
increase it to fifteen fathoms, but with the result of fixing it at the
first named figure where it has remained to the present. Much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
confusion was caused by the misunderstanding of the term "adoption
fee" many supposing it to be the total fee for membership,
including all three degrees. It was here defined as meaning the
fee for the "adoption" or first degree of Redmanship.</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records presented his long talk from which
the following data is obtained:&mdash;Adopted, 2158; admitted by card,
133; reinstated, 44; suspended, 467; expelled, 16; withdrawn by
card, 61; deceased, 40; present membership, 5,053; disbursed by
Tribes for relief, $6,633.94; for burial of the dead, $1,604.00; for
other purposes, $18,085.74; invested by Tribes, $6,705.10. total
worth of Tribes, $28,280.65.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee reported having found the books and
accounts of the Great Chief of Records and Great Keeper of Wampum
in correct form, and made the following recommendations,
which were concurred in:&mdash;</p>

<p>That Councils of the Degree of Pocahontas be assessed five in.
per Great Sun for each female member, for the benefit of the
Orphans' Guardian Fund of the Great Council of the United
States.</p>

<p>That the Great Sachem and Exemplifier be allowed the sum of
$1,000 for the ensuing great sun.</p>

<p>That the printing of the Record be awarded to the Louisville
Anzeiger Co. at $1.10 per page.</p>

<p>That the Assistant Great Chief of Records be allowed fifty
fathoms for services rendered.</p>

<p>Past Great Incohonee Thos. K. Donnalley, of Pennsylvania,
representing the Great Incohonee of the Great Council of the
United States, Thomas G. Harrison, of Indiana, addressed the
Great Council and exemplified the unwritten work of the Order.</p>

<p>The Committee on State of the Order expressed the sentiments
of all in the following:&mdash;"Throughout the entire reservation there
is universal complaint at the carelessness and delay in getting the
proceedings of the last Great Council in hands of the various
Tribes." Although the copy had been furnished promptly to the
printer, the book in question had not been delivered until just
prior to the present session.</p>

<p>The Committee on Returns and Reports, of which Robert Lee
Page was chairman paid the following tribute to Great Sachem
Pelham:&mdash;"Under his guidance and administration the Order has
prospered and grown in strength. His advice and decisions have
been fair and impartial and his conduct such as to meet with the
approbation of the entire membership. His administration is one
that will ever be remembered, and we feel that we cannot give him
the praise he so richly deserves. We could with greater ease add
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
beauty to the lily or fragrance to the rose than we could adequately
express our appreciation of Bro. Pelham."</p>

<p>The following resolution was adopted:&mdash;That the Horse's Head
on an Indian Shield as recommended by the Great Council of the
United States be adopted as the totem of this Great Council, and
that this Great Council reserve unto itself the right to control the
manufacture and disposal of the said Totem or jewel.</p>

<p>The Committee on Charters recommended that charters be
granted to the following new Tribes, which was agreed to:&mdash;Kabo,
No. 78, Petra; Eyota, No. 87, Ball's Landing; Swift Foot, No. 88,
Campbellsburg; Tallalu, No. 89, Callaway; War Eagle, No. 90,
Bedford; Idaho, No. 91, Four Mile; Tallapoosa, No. 92, Milton;
Mingo, No. 93, Newport; Sago, No. 94, Germantown; Wissahickon,
No. 95, Lockport; Iona Council, No. 6, D. of P., Pittsburg.</p>

<p>Great Prophet Ellerkamp offered the following suggestions,
which were adopted:&mdash;</p>

<p>That memorial page or pages be printed in each great sun's
record containing the names of all brothers deceased during the
previous great sun.</p>

<p>That at the opening of each Great Council every representative
be handed a copy of the last record and a copy of the manual.</p>

<p>That the Asst. Great Chief of Records prepare a page or pages
containing all new laws and resolutions enacted and also all unfinished
business.</p>

<p>It was ordered that the Great Chief of Records prepare and have
printed a suitable form upon which Deputy Great Sachems shall
hereafter make their reports.</p>

<p>That matter of deferred business, consisting of the report of
the special Committee on Widow's and Orphan's Home Fund was
taken up, and on motion of Past Sachem H. C. Yunker, of No. 7
was laid on the table.</p>

<p>An amendment to the laws was offered to lay over one great
sun providing a penalty for electioneering.</p>

<p>Another to take the same course was offered providing for holding
the Great Sun Council in Hot Moon instead of Flower Moon.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee recommended the payment of mileage
to 78 Representatives, Great Chiefs and members of Committees,
amounting to $753.53, being an average of $9.66 per member.</p>

<p>Past Great Incohonee Thomas K. Donalley proceeded to raise
the Great Chiefs elect, appointing as Great Tocakon Past Great
Sachem Willie Walker.</p>

TENTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The Tenth Great Sun Council Fire of the Great Council of
Kentucky was kindled in the wigwam of Otego Tribe, No. 60, at
Owensboro, at the 11th run rising of the 10th sun of Flower Moon,
G. S. D. 413.</p>

<p>Prior to the kindling, introductory exercises were held as follows:&mdash;Addresses
by Mayor Yeiser, and Judge R. V. Lightfoot,
with responses by Bros. R. L. Page, S. C. Moore, and Great Minewa,
Thos. J. Smith, representing the Great Incohonee.</p>

<p>At the kindling of the council fire there were present all the
Great Chiefs, except Great Prophet, three Past Great Sachems and
75 Past Sachems.</p>

<p>Lee W. Zweydorf, of No. 7 and Ben H. Schrader, of No. 5 were
appointed to assist the Great Junior Sagamore in the examination
of Credentials.</p>

<p>Past Great Sachem Willie Walker of No. 1 was appointed Great
Prophet for the session, Great Prophet Pelham being unable to
be present.</p>

<p>Upon the recommendation of the Credential Committee fifty-seven
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Past Sachems were admitted to seats in the Great Council,
and the representatives of sixty-two Tribes were recognized. The
attendance this session was 136.</p>

<p>It was agreed that Representatives of Tribes instituted so
recently as not to be legally entitled to representation be allowed
mileage.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem announced the following appointments on
committees to fill vacancies:&mdash;</p>

<p>State of the Order&mdash;C. P. Harding, of No. 5; L. H. Roberts,
of No. 10.</p>

<p>Charters&mdash;Claude B. Terrell, of No. 90; J. M. Clifford, of No.
10; Hugh Johnson, of No. 81.</p>

<p>A communication was read from Great Incohonee Thomas G.
Harrison, expressing his regret at not being able to be present and
appointing Great Minewa, Thomas J. Smith as his representative.</p>

<p>The Deputy or Acting Great Incohonee was announced in the
Forest and Past Great Sachems Willie Walker, Ellerkamp and John
D. Walker were appointed as escorts, when he was admitted with
the usual honors.</p>

<p>Great Sachem McFarlan presented his long talk in print,
from which the following extracts are made:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have much for which to extend thanks to the Great Spirit
who has so kindly 'blessed us with plenty' and 'rewarded our labors
two-fold'; at least have we not to be content with present conditions
which everywhere indicate that the affairs of the Order are
in splendid condition; that the affairs of the Great Council are in
safe hands and that the rank and file is made up of indefatigable
and competent workers, who are filled with enthusiasm and an
earnest desire to advance the Order to that high and prominent
position which it must eventually occupy and which every Red Man
wishes it to attain. From every source comes to me good tidings
of noble work being carried on; of palefaces being adopted; of a
search for a better understanding of the fundamental principles
and laws of the Order; Peace and harmony; good fellowship and
brotherhood. I believe we can safely say that during the next
Great Sun our membership will be increased to the extent that we
shall have a larger representation in the Great Council of the
United States. I wish that I could say my administration was one
of perfection.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">'It surely was my profit had I known,</span>
    <span class="i0">It would have been my pleasure had I seen.</span>
  </div></div>
</div>

<p>"There have been sent to me words of encouragement; words of
discouragement; words of hope; words of despair; words of praise;
words of censure; but through all, gathering to himself the flowers
of love, patience, kindness and sympathy, he has pressed on, giving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
to you his sincerest and best efforts, and now, extending to his
brothers his thanks for these flowers, he greets you in truth, in
Freedom, Friendship and Charity."</p>

<p>The Great Sachem recounted the institution of ten new Tribes
and two new Councils of the Degree of Pocahontas, as well as the
relighting of the council brand of Sagwa Tribe, No. 69, at Lawrenceburg.</p>

<p>He recited a long list of decisions, nearly all of which met with
approval.</p>

<p>Concerning the Degree of Pocahontas he said:&mdash;"My report
would be both inadequate and insufficient, indeed, should I fail
to make some mention of the Degree of Pocahontas, now an important
factor in our great American Order, and whose members
are actuated and inspired to noble work by those cardinal principles
we as Red Men hold so dear, Freedom, Friendship and Charity.
The auxiliary is certainly becoming popular, and is now in a prosperous
condition, and from information I can advisedly say that
wherever it is established properly will prove a valuable adjunct
to our work. I might add by way of suggestion or recommendation
that it would be a wise move to establish as soon as practicable
in this Reservation a Great Council of the Degree of Pocahontas,
believing it is due them, and that much more good can come from
this branch of the Order if they have the right and privilege
extended them to counsel and legislate. * * * I note that the
Great Incohonee in his report very pertinently remarks: 'This Degree
deserves from the Great Council its wisest consideration, and
no pains should be spared in any matters which may effect the interests
and increase the usefulness of our Councils.'"</p>

<p>Cherokee Tribe, No. 8 and Hiawatha Tribe, No. 7, both of
Louisville met with the misfortune to lose their charters and
effects in the burning of the Masonic Temple on the 20th of Beaver
Moon, G. S. D. 412, and the Great Sachem granted both Tribes
dispensations to work without a charter until the Great Council
should grant then new Charters.</p>

<p>On the 18th of Worm Moon, G. S. D. 413, by invitation of Great
Sachem McFarlan, Great Incohonee Thos. G, Harrison made a
visit to Kentucky, and a reception and banquet was given in his
honor at the Louisville Hotel. More than two hundred guests
were entertained, and the occasion was one of particular moment
to Redmanship in this Reservation. In his Long Talk, the Great
Sachem records extracts from many of the addresses, words of
wisdom, encouragement and commendation.</p>

<p>From the Long Talk of Great Chief of Records Ray, the following
statistics of the Order are taken:&mdash;Adopted since last report,
1152; admitted by card, 60; reinstated, 11; suspended, 594; expelled,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
19; withdrawn, 50; deceased, 41; disbursed for relief, $9,015.29;
for burial of the dead, $1,969.89; for other purposes, $14,396.12;
invested by Tribes, $17,895.60; Total fund of Tribes, $35,589.28;
number of working tribes, 73; number of Councils Degree of
Pocahontas, 7.</p>

<p>The Great Keeper of Wampum reported the cash balance on
hand as being $2,191.95.</p>

<p>An election for Assistant Great Chief of Records was then
entered into with the result that Past Sachem Frank L. Smith, of
No. 1 was re-elected, Past Sachem J. Robin Garr, of No. 99 being
also in nomination.</p>

<p>A committee was appointed, Acting Great Incohonee Thos. J.
Smith, presiding, to draft resolutions of sympathy and condolence
on account of the recent death of the infant son of Great Sachem
McFarlan, the following serving in that capacity:&mdash;N. G. Mothershead,
of No. 57; C. P. Harding, of No. 5 and Claude B. Terrell,
of No. 90.</p>

<p>The Great Council then went into the election of Great Chiefs
with the following results:&mdash;</p>

<p>Horace J. McFarlan, of No. 33, was unanimously elected Great
Prophet.</p>

<p>H. H. Denhardt, of No. 11 was elected Great Sachem without
opposition.</p>

<p>Lewis L. Bebout, of No. 60 was elected Great Senior Sagamore,
there being no other nominations.</p>

<p>Dan H. Russell, of No. 10 was elected Great Junior Sagamore,
other nominees being Robert Lee Page, of No. 80, and Ben C.
Nunn, of No. 14, the latter asking that his name be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Henry W. Ray, of No. 3 was elected Great Chief of Records
for the second time, without opposition.</p>

<p>S. C. Moore, of No. 7 was unanimously elected Great Keeper
of Wampum for the third time. Dr. Harry J. Phillips was nominated
for this position, but he refused to become a candidate.</p>

<p>Horace J. McFarlan, Robert Lee Page and Lawrence S.
Leopold were elected Great Representatives for two great suns each,
the other candidates in nomination being G. A. Ellerkamp, of No.
8; Ben H. Shrader, of No. 5; John D. Walker, and Willie Walker,
of No. 1.</p>

<p>At the request of Acting Great Incohonee Thos. J. Smith, State
Exemplifier, Frank L. Smith, the recognized custodian of the work
in Kentucky exemplified the unwritten work of the Order.</p>

<p>Frankfort was unanimously accepted as the hunting grounds
in which the next Great Sun Council fire should be kindled.</p>

<p>The Great Council of the United States having adopted a new
Code of laws embracing a new Constitution governing State Great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Councils, it was ordered that the incoming committee on Law and
Usage be augmented by the addition of two members, and they to
prepare a new code of laws governing the Great Council of Kentucky
and the Tribes under its jurisdiction, to report in print to the
various Tribes, and their report to be reviewed at the next Great
Sun Council.</p>

<p>The contract for the printing for the ensuing Great Sun was let
to the Louisville Anzeiger Co. at $1.10 per page.</p>

<p>The amendment to the law laid over from last Great Council
making electioneering a penal act was adopted.</p>

<p>The Great Council refused to change the time for holding the
Great Sun Council from Flower Moon to Hot Moon.</p>

<p>It was ordered that each Past Great Sachem of the Great Council
be presented with Past Great Sachem's Jewel, to cost no more
than 25 fathoms each.</p>

<p>The Committee which had been previously appointed to prepare
new Articles of Incorporation not having reported, the Great
Sachem was authorized to appoint another Committee.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee recommended the payment of mileage
to Great Chiefs, Representatives and members of standing committees,
82 in number, amounting to $1,403.19, averaging $17.11
each.</p>

<p>The Great Council then went into the Committee of the Whole
for the consideration of amendments to the laws.</p>

<p>Upon the recommendation of the Finance Committee the following
appropriations were made:&mdash;</p>

<p>To the Tribe entertaining the Great Council each Great sun,
$150.00.</p>

<p>To the Assistant Great Chief of Records for services, $75.00.</p>

<p>To the Great Sachem for the use of himself and State Exemplifier,
$1,250.</p>

<p>A new code of laws governing the organization and institution
of Tribes was adopted. Up to this time the matter of organization
had been conducted much upon the "go as you please" plan, each
Great Sachem using his own judgment in the matter. The adoption
of definite laws governing this matter was a boon to following
Great Sachems.</p>

<p>A regulation was adopted requiring financial chiefs of the Great
Council and Tribes and Councils of the Degree of Pocahontas to
be bonded in such indemnity company as might be selected by the
Finance Committee from time to time.</p>

<p>An amendment was offered to be considered at the next Great
Sun Council providing for the nomination and election of Great
Chiefs on the second sun of the session instead of the first.</p>

<p>An amendment was offered defining the bounds of Deputy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
Great Sachems, providing for districts, and for the holding of district
meetings for the purpose of exemplification, but same was laid
over for one great sun.</p>

<p>Upon the recommendation of the Committee on Charters the
following named Tribes and Councils of the Degree of Pocahontas
were granted charters:&mdash;Niagara, No. 96, Orangeburg; Kenawha,
No. 97, Vanceburg; Pontiac, No. 98, Louisville; Wauneeka, No.
99, Louisville; Buffalo, No. 100, Sardis; Raritan, No. 101, Worthville;
Modoc, No. 102, Louisville; Ute, No. 103, Torrent; Lackawanna,
No. 4, Salt Lick; Catawba, No. 105, Prestonville; Tamina,
No. 106, Jennings; Ramona Council, No. 7, Augusta; Hiawatha
Council, No. 8, Fourmile; Mojave Council, No. 9, Maysville;
Charters were also ordered issued to Cherokee, No. 8, and Hiawatha,
No. 7, both of Louisville, both having been lost by fire.</p>

<p>It was ordered that a special committee be appointed to take
charge of any orphan matters, to investigate, and take the proper
steps to secure them the benefits of the Orphans' Guardian Fund.
The Great Sachem appointed Ben C. Nunn, of No. 14; O. R. King,
of No. 1; A. C. Fahrenberg, of No. 10.</p>

<p>Acting Great Incohonee Thomas J. Smith proceeded to raise
the elective and appointive Great Chiefs, with the assistance of
Past Great Sachem Willie Walker, of No. 1, Acting Great Tocakon.</p>

<p>The special committee on Orphans reported they had performed

Prophet had said a prayer, the council fire was quenched.</p>

<h3><b>1905.</b><br /><br />

ELEVENTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The eleventh Great Sun Council fire of the Great Council of
Kentucky was kindled in the Council Chamber of Blackfoot Tribe,
No. 67, Hunting Grounds of Frankfort, at the 11th run, 30th
breath, rising of the 9th Sun of Flower Moon, G. S. D. 414. Previous
to the kindling of the Council Fire addresses of welcome, with
responses, interspersed with music, were delivered by Hon. James
Darnell, Mayor; Great Sachem H. H. Denhardt; Bro. T. H. Crockett,
of No. 67; Great Senior Sagamore L. L. Bebout. When the
friends and guests had departed, the regular session began, all
the elective Great Chiefs being present, and 90 Past Sachems.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem appointed the following to fill vacancies
for the session:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ben. C. Nunn, of No. 14, Great Sannap.</p>

<p>M. M. Harbeson, of No. 7, Great Mishinewa.</p>

<p>Chintz Royalty, of No. 38, Great Guard of Wigwam.</p>

<p>To assist the Great Junior Sagamore in the examination of credentials
the Great Sachem appointed W. M. Toomey, of No. 83;
and Frank Wagner, of No. 14.</p>

<p>A communication was received from Great Incohonee J. W.
Cherry, announcing that Great Guard of the Forest Jas. H. Cook
had been commissioned to represent him at this session, and he being
announced as being in the forest, Great Representatives Louis
Vissman, John H. Buschemeyer and Robt. Lee Page were appointed
to escort him into the Council Chamber.</p>

<p>Acting Great Incohonee James H. Cook was formally introduced
and greeted with the honors of the Order.</p>

<p>It was agreed that the representatives of Tribes so recently
instituted as not to be legally entitled to representation be admitted
and allowed mileage.</p>

<p>Upon the recommendation of Great Junior Sagamore D. H.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
Russell, 66 Past Sachems in waiting were introduced and received
the Great Council Degree.</p>

<p>Upon the recommendation of the same Great Chief, the credentials
of the representatives of 67 Tribes, and they being present
were accorded seats as such in the Great Council.</p>

<p>The total attendance at this session was 145.</p>

<p>The following were appointed to fill vacancies on Committees:&mdash;</p>

<p>Judiciary&mdash;M. B. Wallerstein, of No. 60.</p>

<p>Orphans&mdash;E. M. Wallace, of No. 5 and J. G. Renaker, of No. 37.</p>

<p>Charters&mdash;J. C. Lykins, of No. 113; M. M. Redding, of No.
64; W. H. McDonald, of No. 111.</p>

<p>Great Sachem H. H. Denhardt, as was now the custom, presented
his Long Talk in print, and the following extracts will be
of interest:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As the members of the Great Council of Kentucky assemble
in peace and harmony around this Great Sun's Council fire, we
can congratulate ourselves upon the close of the most prosperous
year in the history of the Order in Kentucky. From Paducah our
runners swiftly to their Tribes returned spreading the spirit of
true fraternity there engendered into every wigwam in our Reservation,
and as a result the council fires of the various Tribes have been
kept brightly burning; discord has been banished from their midst;
and the braves and warriors have become accustomed to assemble
not for the purpose of wrangling among themselves, of gaining some
petty advantage over another brother or over another Tribe, but
plans for the capturing of palefaces were discussed and as a result
at least two thousand palefaces' scalps are dangling at the belts of
our warriors and braves.</p>

<p>This Great Sun has been one fraught with many blessings
and pleasures. The propitious sky has occasionally been obscured
by a fleeting cloud, but the passing shadow only intensified the
brightness that followed.</p>

<p>Through the sunshine and the shadows, the pleasures and
trials, our beloved Order has grown until now it has taken rank as
one of the most prosperous fraternal societies in Kentucky.</p>

<p>I have brought to the performance of the duties devolving upon
me my best energies, my untiring efforts and all the zeal and industry
I could command. It, no doubt, is true that I have not
measured up to the full requirements of the high and important
Chieftaincy to which your over-kindness has elevated me; I have,
however, labored with an eye single to the advancement of our
Order. I have tried to be diligent, sought to be impartial and endeavored
to be zealous and faithful."</p>

<p>Concerning Councils of the Degree of Pocahontas he said:&mdash;"I
have done what I could to promote the welfare of this most excellent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
branch of our order. Some progress has been made, but
still there is need of encouragement being given those who are
striving to push forward the cause of this Degree."</p>

<p>He reported the institution of twenty-one new Tribes and two
Councils of the Degree of Pocahontas, as well as the resuscitation
of four Tribes and one Council D. of P.</p>

<p>Concerning the Widows' and Orphans' Home Fund he said:&mdash;"It
seemed to be almost the unanimous opinion of those to whom
I talked concerning this matter that the time for the creation of
this fund had arrived even at the last Great Council; however, no
action was taken. I believe that the movement to establish a Home
for the Widows and Orphans of Kentucky Red Men is the greatest
work ever undertaken by our beloved Order in Kentucky. When
we establish a Home of this sort we are doing some real good in
the world and that is what our Order exists for, and that is, or
should be, the aim of every member of the Order."</p>

<p>After publishing a list of subscriptions to the Home Fund
amounting to $438.30, and having recounted a long list of visitations,
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Angel of Death has laid his hand heavily on our Order
during the past Great Sun. Mary McFarlan, wife of Horace J.
McFarlan, Great Prophet of the Great Council of Kentucky, died
on the 15th Sun of Buck Moon, G. S. D. 413.</p>

<p>Thomas Alden Hornsey, Past Great Sachem of the Great
Council of Kentucky died on the 12th Sleep of Beaver Moon,
G. S. D. 413.</p>

<p>Thomas H. Watts, Great Incohonee of the Great Council of
the United States, died on the 29th Sun of Worm Moon, G. S. D.
414.</p>

<p>Past Sachem M. J. Madden, member of the Widows' and Orphans'
Committee of this Great Council died on the 17th Sun of
Worm Moon, G. S. D. 414."</p>

<p>After an account of dispensations granted, decisions made, and
details of minor transactions, the Great Sachem closes with thanks
to his associates and to the Great Council.</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Record's Long Talk affords the following
information:&mdash;Adopted since last report, 1,994; admitted by card,
118; reinstated, 13; suspended, 643; expelled, 14; withdrawn, 81;
deceased, 72; present membership, 6,993; disbursed for relief,
$10,958.09; for burials, $3,436.31; for other purposes, $25,326.71;
invested, $24,107.60; total fund of Tribes, $46,302.86; Tribes
instituted since last report, 21; number of working Tribes 91.</p>

<p>The Great Keeper of Wampum reported the cash balance in
the Great Council wampum belt as being $1,886.30; in the Widows'
and Orphans' Home Fund, $438.30.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>The election for Great Chiefs resulted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lewis L. Bebout, of No. 60 was elected Great Sachem unanimously.</p>

<p>Dan. H. Russell, of No. 10 was elected Great Senior Sagamore
without opposition.</p>

<p>H. H. Denhardt, of No. 11 was elected Great Prophet, by acclamation,
there being no other nominees.</p>

<p>Robert Lee Page, of No. 80 was elected Great Junior Sagamore,
Past Sachem J. W. Matthews, of No. 67 being also in nomination.
J. H. Kemper of No. 18 had been nominated, but desired his name
to be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Henry Wood Ray, of No. 3 was unanimously elected Great Chief
of Records for the third consecutive term.</p>

<p>S. C. Moore, of No. 7 was, upon motion of O. R. King, of No.
1, who had been placed in nomination against him, unanimously
re-elected Great Keeper of Wampum for the fourth consecutive
term. Past Sachem King declined to be a candidate.</p>

<p>Gustav A. Ellerkamp, of No. 8; John H. Buschemeyer, of No.
8; W. A. Crader, of No. 8, and M. B. Wallerstein, of No. 60 were
elected Great Representatives to the Great Council of the United
States for two Great Suns each. Other candidates in nomination
were Lawrence S. Leopold, of No. 8; Frank L. Smith, of No. 1
and C. P. Harding of No. 5.</p>

<p>The Great Council agreed unanimously to return to Frankfort
one Great Sun hence and again kindle its Great Sun Council fire
in the Capitol City.</p>

<p>Past Sachem Albert Miller of No. 1 presented the Great Council
with a magnificent Great Sachem's Stump, carved from the
solid wood in representation of a Chieftain's bust, decorated with
feathers and emblems of the Order.</p>

<p>The Committee on Revision of the Laws, which had been appointed
at the previous Great Council, now presented its report in
print. Shortly after the adjournment one great sun ago, the committee
had met, and realizing the magnitude of the work before
them, expressed its belief that one brother could accomplish the
desired result with less difficulty and in a shorter time than a
number, and agreed to employ Past Sachem Frank L. Smith, of
No. 1, to do the work, if he would undertake it. That chief accepting
the commission, submitted his report to the full committee
in Sturgeon Moon, G. S. D. 413, and with slight changes was
adopted by the committee.</p>

<p>This report, embracing an entirely new code of law, founded
upon the general plan outlined by the Great Council of the United
States, making an entire separation of the legislative, executive and
judicial departments, was now before the Great Council, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
went into the Committee of the Whole for its consideration. Upon
the rising of the committee, the laws as presented by the Revision
Committee were adopted, with the exception of that article relating
to the establishment of the Widows' and Orphans' Home Fund.
This article was made a special order of business, and was the subject
of earnest debate.</p>

<p>Those opposing the adoption of the law were not adverse to
the principle, but to the method of applying relief to the needy,
their plan, which they wished to substitute for a Widows' and Orphans'
Home, was the establishment of an Endowment Fund, the
income from which should be used to defray the expenses of its
beneficiaries in private homes rather than in an institution. After
protracted debate, the law as presented by the Committee on Revision,
establishing the Widows' and Orphans' Home Fund, with
some slight technical alterations, was adopted by an almost unanimous
vote. The law as finally adopted was almost identical with
that presented at the previous Great Council and which was then
tabled.</p>

<p>The Committee on Incorporation of the Great Council presented
a verbal report, stating that articles had been prepared and would
be submitted when properly recorded. The articles prepared by
this committee, while published as preface to the new code of laws,
were never recorded, and consequently never were in operation.</p>

<p>Upon the recommendation of the Committee, charters were
ordered issued to the following named Tribes: Juanita, No. 107,
Ghent; Kenton, No. 108, Artemus; Wautauga, No. 109, Bosworth;
Wabash, No. 110, Nicholasville; Tchoupitoulas, No. 111, Barbourville;
Winnebago, No. 112, Henderson; Ocono, No. 113, Campton;
Tonawanda, No. 114, Grayson; Minnehaha, No. 115, Cropper;
Saco, No. 116, West Liberty; Neponset, No. 117, Jackson; Akkeewassa,
No. 118, Cannel City; Ganoga, No. 119, Gratz; Navajo,
No. 120, Sandy Hook; Tacoma, No. 121, Hazel Green; Oseetah,
No. 122, Redwine; Kinniconick, No. 125, Bowen; Seminole, No.
126, Denniston; Apache, No. 127, Robbins; Indianola Council, No.
10, D. of P., Carrollton. A new charter was also granted Calumet
Tribe, No. 18, theirs having been destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>The Committee on Appeals rendered several decisions, which
were approved, but it is not thought best to here record them, they
being of a personal nature.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee recommended the payment of mileage
to 100 Great Chiefs, Representatives and members of Standing
Committees, amounting to $661.32, being an average of $6.6123
per member paid.</p>

<p>That committee recommended a Bonding Company; that the
printing be awarded to the Louisville Anzeiger Co.; that the salary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
of the Assistant Great Chief of Records be increased to $150.00;
all of which were approved.</p>

<p>The Assistant Great Chief of Records now being an appointee
of the Great Chief of Records, G. C. of R. Ray appointed Frank
L. Smith, of No. 1, to that position.</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records presented to the Great Council the
set of jewels said to have been in use by the old Great Council of
Kentucky at the time of its demise, they having been secured
through the efforts of the members of Miami Tribe, No. 17, and
Mingo Tribe, No. 93, both of Newport, and it was agreed they
should be worn by the Chiefs of the present Great Council. The
jewels, however, proved not to be Great Council Jewels, being of
silver, but the regulation Tribal Jewels.</p>

<p>Acting Great Incohonee Jas. H. Cook, having appointed Past
Great Sachem G. A. Ellerkamp as Great Tocakon, raised the following
elective and appointive Great Chiefs:</p>

<p>After appropriate resolutions of thanks, and when the Great
Prophet had invoked the Great Spirit, the council fire was quenched.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Code of Laws as adopted at the Eleventh Great Sun Council
was approved by the Judiciary Committee of the Great Council
of the United States, entire, yet when that Great Council met in
Great Sun Council in Corn Moon, G. S. D. 414, the committee
recommended that its action be reversed in approving that part of
the Laws of the Great Council of Kentucky relating to the establishment
of the Widows' and Orphans' Home Fund. Appeal was
taken to the Great Board of Appeals of the Great Council of the
United States, and that Great Board ruled the whole matter in
conflict with the Constitution of the Great Council of the United
States, which Great Council reserved unto itself the exclusive right
to legislate concerning the maintenance of orphans.</p>

<p>The effect of this ruling was to make nul and void all legislation
by the Great Council of Kentucky concerning the Widows'
and Orphans' Home Fund. The laws as enacted at the eleventh
Great Council were again submitted to the Judiciary Committee
of the Great Council of the United States, minus any reference to
a Widows' and Orphans' Home Fund, and were then approved and
published.</p>

<h3><b>1906.</b><br /><br />

TWELFTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The Twelfth Great Sun Council fire of the Great Council of
Kentucky was kindled in the Legislative Hall of the State Capitol,
hunting grounds of Frankfort, by courtesy of Blackfoot Tribe, No.
67, at the 11th run, 40th breath, rising of the 8th sun of Flower
Moon, G. S. D. 415.</p>

<p>Prior to the kindling of the council fire, addresses of welcome
and responses were delivered by Gov. J. C. W. Beckham, Mayor E.
E. Hume, Col. G. B. Harper, Great Sachem L. L. Bebout, Great
Senior Sagamore D. H. Russell, Representative T. Hiter Crockett,
Great Junior Sagamore Robert L. Page, Past Great Sachem H. H.
Denhardt, and Wilson Brooks, Great Chief of Records of the Great
Council of the United States.</p>

<p>After the visitors had retired, the council fire was kindled in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
ample form, all elective Great Chiefs being present, seven Great
Representatives, five Past Great Sachems and 112 Past Sachems.</p>

<p>Great Chief of Records Ray appointed F. L. Smith as Assistant
Great Chief of Records.</p>

<p>Great Sachem Bebout appointed Claude B. Terrell, of No. 90,
and Con. Trauth, of No. 7, to assist the Great Junior Sagamore
in the examination of credentials. He also appointed Harry J.
Richardson, of No. 3, to fill a vacancy on Committee on Returns
and Reports, all other members of Standing Committees being
present.</p>

<p>Upon the recommendation of the Credential Committee, 102
Past Sachems were admitted for the first time. The total attendance
at this session was 204.</p>

<p>The roll call of representatives revealed the presence of a representative
from each of 83 Tribes out of 109 entitled to representation.</p>

<p>Great Sachem Bebout presented his long talk in print, as usual,
and the following extracts reveal the general condition of the Order
at that time:</p>

<p>"Our runners have been busy in paying visitations to the various
hunting grounds in this reservation, and from each hunting ground
where a Tribe of our Order exists comes the glad tidings that our
brothers are dwelling in peace and harmony.</p>

<p>No longer does the pale face nation look with distrust upon
our warriors, but truly the "tomahawk has been buried" and the
Red Men and pale face meet as friends.</p>

<p>I desire first of all to recall to your minds the motto of our
beloved "Old Kentucky", "United we stand, divided we fall," and
trust this may be adopted in our deliberations. The Improved
Order of Red Men has a mission to perform among our fellow men
that we alone can perform.</p>

<p>We are now permited to report the establishment and institution
of more tribes within our borders, since the quenching of our
last Great Sun Council fire than during any Great Sun since our
Order has been in existence."</p>

<p>Great Sachem Bebout is in error. He reports the institution
of 29 new Tribes, while during Willie Walkers administration
(G. S. D. 409-410) 32 new Tribes were organized.</p>

<p>"Our representatives at our last Great Sun's Council placed upon
the pages of our speaking book a law, in accordance with the
fundamental teachings of our Order, which provided for the creation
of a fund to be used in the establishment of a Home within our
borders, which should be a shelter for the unfortunates of our
Tribes, who may not be able to withstand the trials and hardships
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
which attend the unprotected in this busy, hustling commercial age
in which we live.</p>

<p>In the Great Book of Life we find this expression, 'And a little
child shall lead them.' How true this is in this instance. The
little children of the membership of Irondequoit Tribe, No. 38,
located at Hardinsburg, were the first contributors to this fund.</p>

<p>After the enactment of this law, with the other laws enacted
by us, the whole was presented to the Judiciary Committee of the
Great Council of the United States for their approval, and having
received the approval of that committee were promulgated to the
Tribes."</p>

<p>The fate of this measure has already been recorded on these
pages, and the Great Council at this time found itself with an overwhelming
sentiment in favor of the law as previously passed or a
similar one, but without the power of enactment.</p>

<p>Continuing, the Great Sachem said: "Realizing that the desire
of our membership is as strong, nay stronger than ever before, for
the establishment of a Red Men's Widows' and Orphans' Home
in our beloved State, I beg to suggest that your Representatives
to the Great Council of the United States be instructed to request
that Great Council to pass an enabling act which will permit you
to put your desires into execution. This request, properly presented,
will, in my opinion, appeal to our brothers, members of our
noble order in other reservations, in such a way that your request
will be unanimously granted."</p>

<p>After recounting a list of appointments, visitations made, decisions
and opinions, the Great Sachem again speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"The members of the Great Council are perhaps aware of the
organization of the Great Chief of Records Association of the United
States. This organization meets annually at the same time and
place of the Great Council of the United States, and is composed
of the Great Chiefs of Records of the several reservations. It must
be apparent to all that such an organization will be of material
advantage to the Order, and I desire to recommend that the Great
Council of Kentucky make an allowance and request our Great
Chief of Records to attend and become a member of this organization.</p>

<p>Conforming to the organization of the Great Chief of Records
Association of the United States, I would recommend the organization
of a State Association of Chiefs of Records, to be composed of
the Chiefs of Records of all the Tribes in the Reservation, and urge
upon all Tribes the importance of such an organization, and to
make proper appropriation of wampum for the expense of their
Chief of Records in attending these meetings."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>Regarding Councils of the Degree of Pocahontas, he said: "I
feel that this branch of our work is neglected, and that we should
make more effort to assist our sisters in their noble work. I would
recommend that a permanent committee to be known as the 'Committee
on Degree of Pocahontas' be appointed by the Great Sachem,
and the matter of organization and other duties relating to this
branch of our order be referred to this committee."</p>

<p>The following statistics are taken from the long talk of Great
Chief of Records Henry W. Ray: Adopted since last report, 2,440;
admitted by card, 62; reinstated, 45; suspended, 1,336; expelled,
11; withdrawn, by card, 67; deceased, 79; present membership,
7,651; number of Tribes instituted since last report, 29; number of
working tribes, 109; disbursed by Tribes for relief, $13,508.73;
for burial of dead, $3,513.55; for other purposes, $48,095.02;
amount invested by Tribes, $35,472.24; total worth of Tribes
$59,569.00.</p>

<p>The Great Council by a unanimous vote instructed its Great
Representatives to apply to the Great Council of the United States
for an "enabling act" or to so modify its laws as to permit State
Great Councils to found Homes for their widows' and orphans.
The resolution was offered by Great Senior Sagamore Russell.</p>

<p>A Committee, consisting of Past Great Sachems Willie Walker,
Ellerkamp and McFarland was appointed to escort to the Council
Chamber Great Chief of Records Wilson Brooks, who had been delegated
to represent the Great Incohonee at this session. The committee
performed its duties, and Acting Great Incohonee Wilson Brooks
was received with due honors.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem appointed the following as a committee on
Charters: H. H. Denhardt, of No. 11; D. A. Cross, of No. 60;
J. G. Renaker, of No. 37.</p>

<p>Mention had been made by the Great Sachem in his long talk
of the terrible disaster to the hunting grounds of San Francisco
by earthquake, and of an appeal for aid for sufferers from same.
The Great Chief of Records reported that subscriptions to the
amount of $295.45 had been received and forwarded to the Great
Sachem of the reservation of California.</p>

<p>As at the previous Great Sun's Council an entirely new Code
of laws had been adopted, the Judiciary Committee (formerly Committee
on Law and Usage) had been instructed to continue as a
Committee on Revision, and at this session, quite a number of
amendments were reported by that committee, tending to improve
and "smooth up" the laws, and were adopted.</p>

<p>Another attempt was made to change the time for kindling the
Great Sun Council fire from Flower Moon to Hot Moon but without
success.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>It was claimed that the Articles of Incorporation as printed in
the new Code were faulty, and never having been recorded were
not in force. The Great Representatives to the Great Council of
the United States were appointed a Committee to prepare new
Articles and to have them recorded.</p>

<p>A resolution was offered to amend the laws in such a manner
that the voting franchise should be limited to Representatives of
Tribes only. This resolution was laid over for one Great Sun, but
caused great commotion, as heretofore all Past Sachems had been
qualified to vote upon all questions and in the election for chiefs,
except when the representative vote might be demanded on a
measure of legislation.</p>

<p>The representatives to the Great Council of the United States
were instructed to endeavor to have the laws of the G. C. U. S.
amended so as to provide for biennial instead of annual sessions.</p>

<p>The Great Council went into the election of Great Chiefs with
the following results:</p>

<p>Dan H. Russell, of No. 10 was elected Great Sachem by acclamation.</p>

<p>Robert L. Page, of No. 80 was elected Great Senior Sagamore
without opposition.</p>

<p>Joe H. Kemper, of No. 18 was elected Great Junior Sagamore
on the first ballot, W. H. McDonald, of No. 111 being also in
nomination.</p>

<p>Lewis L. Bebout was unanimously elected Great Prophet.</p>

<p>Henry Wood Ray, of No. 3 was elected Great Chief of Records
for the Fourth consecutive term, Ben. C. Nunn, of No. 14, being
also in nomination.</p>

<p>Herman V. Cohn, of No. 8 was elected Great Keeper of Wampum,
S. C. Moore, of No. 7, who had filled the chieftaincy for four
consecutive terms being defeated for re-election by a narrow margin.</p>

<p>L. L. Bebout, of No. 60, Lawrence S. Leopold, of No. 8 and
H. J. McFarlan, of No. 33; were elected Great Representatives,
the others in nomination being R. L. Page, of No. 80 and Willie
Walker, of No. 1.</p>

<p>The Charter committee recommended the issuing of charters
to the following named Tribes and Councils: Shawnee, No. 77,
Georgetown; Tuscarora, No. 124, Tyrone; Antigo, No. 128, Claysville;
Mendota, No. 131, Corinth; Oneida, No. 132, Cherokee;
Paduke, No. 133, Murray; Logan, No. 134, Ewing; Wahbee, No.
135, Yocum; Wamsutta, No. 136, Dan; Tuscola, No. 137, Warfield;
Connewago, No. 138, Fallsburg; Uppowoc, No. 139, Maytown;
Uchees, No. 140, Rockdale; Tonnuluka, No. 141, Millers
Creek; Nevada, No. 142, Flat Gap; Chickasaw, No. 143, Paintsville;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Algona, No. 144, East Bernstadt; Algonquin, No. 145,
Berry; Shawnese, No. 146, Cave City; Elkatawa, No. 147, Ford;
Natchez, No. 148, Glenwood; Oniska, No. 149, Middlesboro; Cohota,
No. 150, Louisa; Ocono, No. 113, at Campton, to replace one
destroyed by fire; Collo Kene Council, No. 11, D. of P.; Chanzeck,
No. 129, of Lee City, and Lechawa, No. 130, of Mize, were not
granted charters, their council fires having become extinct.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee reported mileage paid to 111 members,
amounting to $752.38 being an average of $6.77<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> per member.</p>

<p>Lexington was selected as the next place for kindling the Great
Sun Council fire, Newport and Frankfort being in nomination.</p>

<p>The question on the limitation of franchise to representatives
only was taken up and lost by a Tribal vote of 47 ayes to 16 nays,
it requiring a four-fifths vote to pass the resolution.</p>

<p>The bill to limit the franchise was again offered to be considered
at the next Great Suns Council.</p>

<p>Acting Great Incohonee Wilson Brooks then raised the Great
Chiefs, appointing Past Great Sachem G. A. Ellerkamp as Great
Tocakon.</p>

was quenched.</p>

<h3><b>1907.</b><br /><br />

THIRTEENTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The Thirteenth Great Sun's Council fire of the Great Council
of Kentucky was kindled in the Auditorium at Woodland Park,
Hunting Grounds of Lexington, under the auspices of Miantonomo
Tribe, No. 1, at the 11th run, 30th breath, rising of the 14th sun
of Flower Moon, G. S. D. 416.</p>

<p>Before the council fire had been kindled addresses of welcome
and response were delivered by Hon. Thos. H. Clay, acting for
Mayor Combs, Great Sachem D. H. Russell, Chief Wallace Muir,
of No. 1, and Past Sachem T. Hiter Crockett, of No. 67.</p>

<p>All of the Great Chiefs were present, eight Great Representatives,
eight Past Great Sachems, and 153 Past Sachems.</p>

<p>Great Chief of Records Henry W. Ray appointed Frank L.
Smith, of No. 1 as Assistant Great Chief of Records.</p>

<p>Great Sachem Russell appointed Past Sachem Sam Marcus, of
No. 8 as a member of the Committee on Returns and Reports to
fill a vacancy.</p>

<p>The same Great Chief appointed the following to constitute a
Committee on Charters:&mdash;Con. Trouth, of No. 7; H. J. McFarlan,
of No. 33; Geo. S. Wiemer, of No. 6.</p>

<p>Great Junior Sagamore Joe H. Kemper reported the presence
of 131 Past Sachems in the Forest with proper credentials, and
they were admitted and received the Great Council Degree. The
total attendance at this Great Council was 268.</p>

<p>The roll call of representatives revealed the presence of the
representatives of 110 Tribes out of 145 eligible to representation.</p>

<p>Great Incohonee W. A. S. Bird of the Great Council of the
United States was admitted and received with the Grand Honors of
the Order.</p>

<p>Great Sachem Russell presented his long talk in print, and the
following quotations will be found of interest, revealing the condition
of the Order at that time:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our membership now numbers over eleven thousand, with
forty-five new Tribes and three new Councils. Redmanship stands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
in Kentucky unchallenged as one of the greatest benevolent fraternities
of modern times, commanding the respect of all acquainted
with its accomplishments, the admiration of all who know its purpose
and the affection of all who participate around the council
brands of our Tribes.</p>

<p>The oldest truly American fraternity has grown greater, stronger
and better in our Reservation and its present position fills with
pride those who have assisted in its marvelous growth during the
past Great Sun, and every member must rejoice in his affiliation
with such a powerful thoroughly American organization.</p>

<p>The Great Sachem, assisted by the brothers of all the Tribes
in Jefferson County, organized a mammoth class adoption of 500
palefaces, and on the sleep of the 28th of Beaver Moon, G. S. D.
415, in the presence of Great Incohonee W. A. S. Bird, more palefaces
were adopted than at any one time in the history of the Order
in Kentucky."</p>

<p>The Great Sachem offered many recommendations for the consideration
of the Great Council, in the nature of amendments to
the laws, particularly regarding the matter of sick and funeral
benefits, and among these recommendations the following:&mdash;concerning
the clause forbidding electioneering:&mdash;"This portion of
Kentucky Laws is unreasonable, inasmuch as it does not give to
the members of our Order the privileges usually accorded to an
American citizen. No harm can be done, and no wrong committed
by the publicity of the personal wishes of a brother of our Order."</p>

<p>Great Sachem Russell records a vast amount of business transacted,
decisions made, appointments, etc., and concludes the records
of a remarkable administration as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We come to this Great Council with every Tribe having reported
and paid its per capita tax, and when the great number of
Tribes in this reservation is considered, it is a remarkable condition,
and it is due to the enthusiastic fraternal spirit that exists in the
hearts of every Red Man in our Reservation.</p>

<p>The American Flag, the emblem of Freedom, renews in every
Red Man's heart the true American spirit that was breathed into
the souls of the Sons of Liberty and which later proclaimed for
them their Independence.</p>

<p>The spirit of Liberty was the foundation of the greatest fraternity
of modern times and this same spirit of freedom that
prompted the Sons of Liberty has been given additional force by
the presence of the Stars and Stripes in the council chambers of the
various Tribes, and engenders more thorough fraternal and patriotic
feeling than any one emblem. I suggest that the Great Council
of Kentucky give each and every Tribe on the night of institution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
this emblem of freedom, so this same spirit will be injected into
the hearts of all the newly adopted brothers."</p>

<p>From the long talk of the Great Chief of Records the following
statistics are taken:&mdash;adopted since last report, 2,853; admitted
by card, 81; reinstated, 145; suspended, 1,623; expelled, 14; withdrawn
by card, 95; deceased, 65; present membership, 8,933;
Number of tribes last report, 109; new tribes, 31; tribes resuscitated,
5; tribes extinct since last report, 17; whole number of tribes
Jan. 1st, 1907, 128. Disbursed for relief, $13,721.55; for burial
of the dead, $2,941.50; for other purposes, $41,566.25; invested
by Tribes, $49,872.96; Total worth of Tribes, $78,001.86.</p>

<p>The Great Council of the United States had, since the last
session of the Great Council of Kentucky, adopted an enabling act,
permitting State Great Councils to legislate for the care and maintenance
of Widows, Orphans and Aged Red Men, and a bill was
now introduced with the following title, being quite similar to the
one previously enacted by the Great Council of Kentucky, but
which had been declared unconstitutional by the supreme authority:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A bill, to provide for the support of Widows and Orphans of
deceased Red Men, and of Aged Red Men, and the ultimate establishment
of a Home for the same."</p>

<p>In one respect the bill was quite different from the former, in
that it provided for the immediate relief of beneficiaries, a portion
of the tax proposed to be levied to be set aside for that purpose.</p>

<p>As has been recorded on these pages, there were two factions
in the Great Council, each eager for the adoption of relief laws,
but with different ideas as to the application of the same. On the
one side were those who desired the immediate establishment of a
Home or Institution, while on the other was the party desiring
the care and support of its beneficiaries within the homes of individuals.
The bill now presented provided for the trial of the
latter plan, while a fund was being accumulated for the adoption
of the former in the future. After discussion in the Committee
of the whole and protracted debate on the floor of the Great Council
the bill was adopted by a Tribal vote of 85 ayes to 11 nays.</p>

<p>The per capita tax was increased from 60 inches per great sun
to 80 inches, fifteen inches of which to be set aside for the relief
fund, and 5 inches of this to be devoted to immediate relief if
required.</p>

<p>Great Sachem Russell immediately appointed the three members
of the Board of Trustees of the Widows', Orphans' and Aged
Red Men's Relief Fund, as provided in the enactment, as follows:&mdash;H.
C. Yunker, of No. 7 for one Great Sun; Ben Rosenthall, of No.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
14 for two Great Suns and Sam Marcus, of No. 8 for three Great
Suns, the Great Sachem and Great Chief of Records being also members
of the Board ex-officio.</p>

<p>A bill was presented providing for the reduction of the commission
to be paid to organizers of new Tribes, but it failed to
pass.</p>

<p>The contract for printing for the ensuing great sun was awarded
to the Louisville Anzeiger Company of Louisville.</p>

<p>Upon the recommendation of the Finance Committee mileage
was paid to 147 Great Chiefs, Representatives and members of
Standing Committees, amounting to $970.86, being an average of
$6.77<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to each.</p>

<p>The old committee on Widows and Orphans reported having
in its possession the sum of $472.68.</p>

<p>A bill was presented for future consideration providing for a
maximum amount to be paid for benefits when the dues of the
beneficiary are paid in advance, and a minimum when not so paid.</p>

<p>Great Sachem Russell was presented with a beautiful emblematic
ring, on behalf of his many friends in the Order.</p>

<p>The famous "Disfranchisement Bill" was withdrawn and thus
came to an end a measure which promised to cause much dissension.</p>

<p>The Committee recommended that charters be issued to the
following named forty-five Tribes and three Councils of the Degree
of Pocahontas, which was the largest number of Tribes ever
instituted under the administration of any Great Sachem of Kentucky,
and the only list excelling in number that under the administration
of Willie Walker, in 1901. This record also excelled any
record ever made by any other State Great Council.</p>

each, other candidates being Willie Walker, of No. 1; H. C. Rhodes,
of No. 60; Louis Vissman, of No. 8.</p>

<p>Frankfort was selected as the place for kindling the next Great
Sun Council fire, though the Finance Committee recommended
St. Matthews.</p>

<p>Great Sachem Russell appointed members of the new Committee
on Degree of Pocahontas, which had been created by an
enactment, as follows: L. H. Roberts, of No. 10; Christ Schwitzer,
of No. 17; Warren Wilson, of No. 91.</p>

<p>Great Sachem elect Page announced that he should consider
the term of the appointees as having expired with his being raised
to the Chieftaincy of Great Sachem, and would then appoint a
new Committee.</p>

<p>Great Incohonee W. A. S. Bird, being obliged to leave, authorized
Past Great Sachem G. A. Ellerkamp to raise the newly elected
Great Chiefs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>The question of quorum was then raised, and it being found
that not a quorum was present, further business could not be entertained,
and Past Great Sachem Ellerkamp proceeded to raise the
Chiefs, first appointing Past Great Sachem Willie Walker as Great
Tocakon.</p>

FOURTEENTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>At the tenth run, rising of the 12th sun of Flower Moon, G.
S. D. 417, there gathered in the Legislative Chamber of the State
Capitol, the Past Sachems of the Kentucky Tribes, visiting and
local Red Men, when, under the auspices of Blackfoot Tribe, No.
67, of Frankfort, addresses of welcome to the Great Council of
Kentucky were delivered by Hon. Jas. T. Buford, in behalf of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
Mayor Hume, Past Sachem T. Hiter Crockett, of No. 67, and
Lieut. Governor Cox, responded to by Great Prophet D. H. Russell,
and Great Junior Sagamore W. H. McDonald, of Barbourville.</p>

<p>At the close of the introductory ceremonies, and when the visitors
had departed, the Great Sun Council fire was kindled in ample
form, all Great Chiefs being present and all Great Representatives,
eight past Great Sachems and two hundred and five Past Sachems.</p>

<p>Great Sachem Robert Lee Page appointed Past Great Sachem
L. L. Bebout and Past Sachem Henry Yunker to assist Great Junior
Sagamore W. H. McDonald in the inspection of credentials.</p>

<p>It being evident that the Legislative Hall was to small to accommodate
the Great Council, it already being crowded with the
old members, and the new not having been introduced, it was decided
to adjourn to the Skating Rink, where the future sessions
were held.</p>

<p>The record of the previous Great Council was approved as
printed, when the Great Sachem presented his Long Talk, the
Credential Committee not being ready to report. The document
being in print was distributed and much interest was manifested
in its perusal. The following extracts will be of especial interest:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My work is done&mdash;my labors over. It has been a Great Sun
of labor, but a labor of love, and one that has the best efforts of
my mind and heart.</p>

<p>I have sought to render efficient and faithful service, and,
while the year has not been free from perplexities and responsibilities,
I trust that I can return unsullied the regalia you bade
me wear. It is an honor to wear the insignia of our Brotherhood&mdash;of
the Fraternity which has done and is doing so much for man
and country, but with power and influence come responsibilities,
and this Great Order needs the care, support and helping hand of
all who constitute its household.</p>

<p>To your efforts am I able to report the largest gain in membership
and the largest number of new Tribes organized than ever
before in the history of this Reservation. In fact, it has been said
that Kentucky has made the best record of any Reservation in the
United States. The Order has prospered beyond precedent or
prophecy.</p>

<p>Pure religion and undefiled before the Great Spirit is this&mdash;To
visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep
himself unspotted from the world."</p>

<p>"Inspired by this Spirit, animated by this faith, exemplifying
these noble precepts by acts of helpfulness, Redmanship has, for
many Great Suns, been a living power within this land, and at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
close of this Great Sun has the confidence of, and dwells in honor
among a free, enlightened people.</p>

<p>We honor a wonderful past, and rejoice in a prosperous present,
yet we know that the work of the Order has not ended, and that
so long as time shall last, and the enemies of society endure, it
will be necessary for this and similar Orders to exist. The need of
good men, honest men, men who believe in manhood and in brotherhood,
who know responsibilities and can assume them, was never
greater than today. This Order has given us men who have lifted
human burdens and have lived to help, aid and assist their fellow
man.</p>

<p>We have a strong, vigorous and constantly expanding organization.
The past with its lessons, its struggles, its successes, is ours.
We live in sunlight now; fortune has favored us; the skies are
bright with promise; surely at the close of this Great Sun, we can
sincerely and honestly repeat:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">Oh Great Spirit from out whose hands,</span>
    <span class="i0">The Great Suns fall like grains of sand,</span>
    <span class="i0">We meet today, united, free,</span>
    <span class="i0">And loyal to our land and Thee,</span>
    <span class="i0">To thank Thee for the era done</span>
    <span class="i0">And trust Thee for the opening one."</span>
  </div></div>
</div>

<p>Concerning the Long House, the Great Sachem said: "As yet,
the manner of raising wampum for this purpose has not been decided
upon. The location of the Long House in this Reservation
means far more for the Kentucky Redman than we realize. It
means that each Great Sun Louisville will be the Mecca for a large
number of the most influential members of our Order. In addition
to this, it will be of great financial benefit to the Red Men
and paleface merchants of Kentucky's metropolis, and, while more
directly beneficial to them, is indirectly beneficial to you. This,
however, should not be considered in comparison to the good that
will result to the Order here."</p>

<p>Among the recommendations of the Great Sachem were the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>That a tax be levied for the purpose of raising a fund for the
erection of a Long House in Louisville by the Great Council of the
United States.</p>

<p>That some action should be taken whereby each member of the
Order can be supplied with a copy of the laws.</p>

<p>That the time of holding the Great Sun Council should be
changed from Flower Moon to Cold Moon.</p>

<p>That the law requiring the Chiefs of Tribes to be bonded
through the chieftaincy of the Great Chief of Records be abolished.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>That the salary of the incoming Great Chief of Records be increased
from five hundred fathoms to nine hundred fathoms.</p>

<p>That a code of laws governing the Trustees of the Widows',
Orphans' and Aged Red Men's Relief Fund be adopted.</p>

<p>After reciting a long list of opinions and decisions rendered,
the Great Sachem enumerates the sixty-five Tribes and three Councils
of the Degree of Pocahontas instituted during his administration,
with dates, and names of Organizers and Instituting Chiefs.</p>

<p>After recounting the dispensations granted by himself and his
Deputies, Great Sachem Page closed his admirable Long Talk as
follows:</p>

<p>"In discharging my duties I have been made a better Red Man
and a better man. I love my fellow-man more to-day than I did
one Great Sun ago. I shall never cease to lend my humble aid
and assistance to the cause of this great fraternity.</p>

<p>In conclusion I trust that in passing judgment upon my
efforts and work you may be able to say: 'He hath done what he
could, and in the best manner he knew how.'"</p>

<p>The following statistics are from the Long Talk of Great
Chief of Records Henry W. Ray:&mdash;</p>

<p>Membership last report, 8,933; adopted, 4,486; admitted by
card, 122; reinstated, 227; suspended, 1,647; expelled, 21; withdrawn

Tribes, $103,576.78; expenses of Great Council for great Sun,
$9,611.46; balance in Great Council wampum belt, $2,208.01.</p>

<p>The Great Representatives to the Great Council of the United
States presented a report of the transactions of the Great Council
of particular interest to the Great Council of Kentucky, and particularly
as to the legislation in regard to the proposed Long House.
The following was reported as having been adopted by the Great
Council of the United States:</p>

<p>"Be it resolved by this Great Council of the United States:
That a committee of three of its members be appointed to devise
ways and means for the erection of the Long House, to be erected
at Louisville, Kentucky, and to report at the next session of this
Great Council. Be it further resolved, that said Committee shall
consist of the present Great Incohonee as Chairman and two Past
Great Incohonees to be selected by the Great Incohonee and to
serve at no expense to this Great Council."</p>

<p>The Credential Committee then reported having approved of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
the credentials of 175 Past Sachems who were in waiting in the
Forest, the same were admitted and instructed in the Great Council
Degree. The same Committee also approved of the Credentials
of the representatives of 143 Tribes. The total attendance was
343 Past Sachems.</p>

<p>A speaking leaf was then read from Great Incohonee W. A. S.
Bird, announcing the appointment of Past Great Sachem D. H.
Russell as his special representative, and the credentials were
acknowledged. Acting Great Incohonee Russell was then received
with the usual honors.</p>

DeHart, of No. 8.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee reported the following recommendations
which were concurred in:</p>

the Great Keeper of Wampum and the Trustees of the Widows',
Orphans' and Aged Red Men's Relief Fund, having been audited
and found correct, be approved.</p>

<p>That the sum of two thousand fathoms be appropriated from
the funds of this Great Council for the use of the Great Sachem in

<p>The Judiciary Committee reported having approved of the
by-laws of 53 Tribes and Councils.</p>

<p>The following amendment to the laws was unanimously adopted
it being mandatory, in conformity to a requirement of the Great
Council of the United States:&mdash;No paleface following the occupation
of saloon keeper, bar tender, liquor dealer or professional
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
gambler shall be eligible to membership in a Tribe of the Improved
Order of Red Men.</p>

<p>Great Senior Sagamore J. H. Kemper, who until this time had
been absent, entered the Council Chamber and was given a fraternal
reception.</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records was authorized to have printed in
convenient form the Constitution governing Tribes.</p>

<p>The Great Chief of Records was authorized and instructed to
attend the sessions of the Great Chief of Records Association, at
the expense of the Great Council.</p>

<p>A model code of by-laws was authorized, under which new
Tribes are required to work at least six moons after instituted.</p>

<p>The law requiring the Great Chief of Records to notify all
Tribes of all suspensions was repealed.</p>

<p>The law requiring the financial chiefs of Tribes to be bonded
in a specified bonding company was repealed, leaving it to each
Tribe to make its own selection of a Company.</p>

<p>The salary of the Great Chief of Records was increased from
500 to 900 fathoms per great sun.</p>

<p>An amendment was presented to provide for additional revenue
for the purpose of erecting a Widows' and Orphans' Home, but
action on same was deferred for one great sun.</p>

<p>An attempt to provide for the appointment of official organizers
was defeated.</p>

<p>The Board of Trustees of the Widows', Orphans' and Aged
Red Men's Relief Fund reported a code of laws to govern that

<p>The report of the Secretary of that Board, Bro. Sam Marcus,
shows, total amount in the Home Fund $1,122.51; total amount

<p>Lexington was selected as the place for the kindling of the next
great sun council fire, Bowling Green and Elizabethtown being
also in nomination.</p>

<p>Past Great Sachem L. L. Bebout in a characteristic speech presented
Great Sachem Robert Lee Page with a beautiful and costly
silver service, the joint gift of many Tribes and individuals.
Great Sachem Page responded, expressing his heartfelt appreciation
of the handsome tribute.</p>

<p>Great Junior Sagamore W. H. McDonald presented a Great
Representative's sash to Acting Great Incohonee D. H. Russell,
which that Great Chief accepted in appropriate terms.</p>

<p>Great Prophet Russell, in behalf of Past Sachem N. Bierman,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
of Cherokee Tribe, No. 8, offered as a reward for faithful work
for the Order an emblematic Ring to the member of the Order
who shall bring into his Tribe the greatest number of new members
in each Great Sun, counting from each Great Council.</p>

<p>The contract for the printing for the ensuing great sun was
let to The Louisville Anzeiger Company, the Record being the base,
at $1.00 per page.</p>

<p>The run having arrived for the election of Great Chiefs, the

BIOGRAPHIES OF PAST GREAT SACHEMS OF KENTUCKY.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM THOMAS ALDEN HORNSEY.</b><br />

1874.</h3>

<p>Thomas Alden Hornsey was a native of New York State, and
on his grandfather's side was of colonial stock, being a lineal descendant
of John Alden and Priscilla, and was a member of the
John Alden Society, the motto of which was, "Why don't you speak
for yourself, John?" His grandmother was a full-blooded Indian,
of the Mohawk Tribe. For many years he conducted a unique
business in Lexington under the sign of the "Wun Hos Hardwair
Stor." Brother Hornsey became a charter member of Osceola
Tribe, No. 8, at its institution in Lexington in 1866, and was its
first Senior Sagamore, succeeding to the stump of Sachem at the
next election. He was admitted to the Great Council of Kentucky
in 1873, and was at that time elected Prophet, it not then being
necessary that one be a Past Great Sachem to be eligible to that
stump. The following Great Sun he was chosen Great Sachem,
and performed the duties of that chieftaincy with marked ability.
Shortly after the expiration of his term, his Tribe, Osceola, No. 8,
became defunct, but before its demise he asked for and was granted
a withdrawal card. Twenty years later, at the institution of Miantonomo
Tribe, No. 1, he became a charter member by depositing
his card, and his honors gained in the old Great Council were recognized.
He was a charter member of the present Great Council and
was twice raised to the stump of Great Prophet of that great body,
thus having the distinction of having served three terms as Great
Prophet. No Red Man was held in greater veneration in this
Reservation, and when the Great Spirit called him on the 12th of
Beaver Moon, G. S. D. 413, the Order lost one of its most valued
counselors and the members of his Tribe a true brother, who never
wearied in well doing.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM THOMAS ALFRED DAVIS</b><br /><br />

1875</h3>

<p>Brother Davis was born in Maysville, Ky., January 17, 1840,
and was educated in the public schools of that city, with one term
in the old Maysville Seminary, leaving that institution at the age
of fourteen. He learned the printing business in Louisville and
Memphis, Tenn., from 1855 to 1858, when he went to Philadelphia,
where he enlisted in 1861 in the famous Pennsylvania Reserve
Corps, from which he was discharged for disability. Subsequently
he became war correspondent with the Army of the Potomac for
the Philadelphia "Enquirer." Later he rejoined the army as private
in Company L, 20th Pennsylvania Cavalry, serving under General
Sheridan, and was mustered out in 1865, then being adjutant
of that regiment. He returned to Maysville in 1866, where he
founded the Maysville Republican, which later became the Daily
Public Ledger, which publication he edited for forty-two years.</p>

<p>At the institution of Wyandotte Tribe, No. 16, in 1871, he became
a charter member, and was immediately elected Sachem. He
was admitted to the Great Council of Kentucky in 1874 and was
elected Great Sachem in 1875. Unfortunately, his Tribe surrendered
its charter before the expiration of his term, and though he
did not transfer his membership to another Tribe, he ranked as a
Past Great Sachem of the old Great Council. At the institution
of the present Wyandotte Tribe, No. 3, he became a charter member,
and his honors were recognized. He was admitted to the
present Great Council in G. S. D. 412 (1903).</p>

<p>Brother Davis was Postmaster of Maysville under the Harrison
administration, 1891-5, and is now State Labor Inspector for Kentucky.
Besides his affiliation with the Red Men, he is a valued
member of the Masonic Orders, Knights of Pythias, Odd Fellows,
G. A. R., Elks, Maccabees, etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM J. HULL DAVIDSON</b><br /><br />

1895</h3>

<p>Brother Davidson was a native of Lexington, and was interested
in many merchantile enterprises. At the time of the rennaisance
of Redmanship in Kentucky he was proprietor of a daily newspaper
called the "Argonaut." He was a charter member of Winona
Tribe, No. 4, which was instituted in Hot Moon, G. S. D., 404,
and was its first Sachem, which stump he filled with marked ability,
and with such zeal, that at the institution of the Great Council
of Kentucky he was selected as its first Great Prophet, retiring at
the end of his term as Past Great Sachem. Shortly afterward
Brother Davidson moved from Lexington to embark in the hotel
business in New York City, where he is at the present time. Unfortunately
for him and for the Order, his interest waned, and
when Winona Tribe consolidated with No. 1, he not being present,
lost his membership.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM JOHN B. MENDENHALL</b><br /><br />

1895-6</h3>

<p>Nothing is known of the nativity of John B. Mendenhall.
During the summer of 1894 he came to Lexington and occupied
the position of operator with the Postal Telegraph Company. Several
great suns previous he had been adopted into Ninegret Tribe,
of Connecticut, and there received the degrees. Shortly after arriving
at Lexington he was appointed Deputy Great Incohonee for
the Reservation of Kentucky by Andrew H. Paton, of Massachusetts,
Great Incohonee of the Great Council of the United States,
the hope being that there might be a rennaisance in Redmanship in
"the dark and bloody ground." The hope was fully realized. Mendenhall
was an organizer, and with the assistance of several local
palefaces he soon had a petition for a charter for Miantonomo
Tribe, No. 1, bearing 121 accepted signatures. The Tribe was instituted
on the sleep of the 5th of Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 403,
by Great Incohonee Paton. During the ensuing great sun seven
other Council Brands were lighted, and pursuant to Deputy Great
Incohonee Mendenhall's call the Past Sachems of the nine Tribes
then in Kentucky assembled in Lexington on the 27th of Hunting
Moon, G. S. D. 404, and the Great Council of Kentucky was instituted,
Mendenhall being chosen as its first Great Sachem. He
served his term as Great Sachem and was elected Great Prophet and
Great Representative to the Great Council of the United States,
but before the lighting of the council brand of that Great Council
in the Corn Moon following, he was tried on charges in Paughcaughnaughsinque
Tribe, No. 6, of Augusta, to which Tribe he had
transferred his membership, preferred by Tribes he had instituted
at Louisville for obtaining wampum from the said Tribes
fraudulently and under false pretenses, and being found guilty,
was expelled from the Order. He soon after left the Reservation,
and his whereabouts at the present time are unknown.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM JAMES R. McCONNELL</b><br /><br />

1896-7</h3>

<p>James R. McConnell came to this country when about ten years
of age, having been born in Belfast, Ireland, April 3, 1847. He
received a common school education and taught for several terms.
With his brother he was engaged in the dry goods business for
several years in Aurora, Indiana, where he resided for many years,
returning to Aurora in 1890, since when he has been living upon
the farm where his wife was born.</p>

<p>Brother McConnell was a noted ritualist in Masonry, and while
in Lexington was elected Master of Lexington Lodge, No. 1, and
at about the time of the rennaisance of Redmanship in this Reservation.
When Mendenhall began his canvass for charter members
of Miantonomo Tribe, No. 1, Brother McConnell was one of the
first approached, and the lending of his name and influence to the
movement assisted in no small degree in the establishment of the
Order in Kentucky. At the institution of Tribe No. 1 he was
elected its first Senior Sagamore, and succeeded to the stump of
Sachem one month later, the Tribe having been instituted on the
5th of Cold Moon, G. S. D. 403, just prior to the close of the term.</p>

<p>A charter member of the Great Council, he was elected its first
Great Senior Sagamore, and was raised to the stump of Great
Sachem at the second session of the Great Council, held at Augusta
in 1896, and was the first Great Sachem to serve a full great sun.
During his administration several new Tribes were added to the
roster of the Great Council, and he visited nearly every Tribe in
the Reservation. At the expiration of his term as Sachem, he was
elected Great Prophet, and served in that capacity the full term,
and afterwards served upon several important committees, attending
every Great Council until his removal to Indiana. He is now
a member of Walla Walla Tribe, No. 229, of Aurora, Indiana, and
ranking as a Past Great Sachem in the Great Council of that
Reservation.

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM WILLIAM EDWIN FITE</b><br /><br />

1897-8</h3>

<p>Brother Fite was born October 20, 1867, near Rome, Adams
County, Ohio. He was educated in the public schools and at the
National Normal University, Lebanon, Ohio. His early life was
spent on the farm. He has been a teacher of much ability, and
has been principal of schools at Wheelersburg and Bethel, Ohio.
He was granted a State Life Certificate by the Ohio Board of School
Examiners in 1890; was employed as Superintendent of Schools of
Augusta, Kentucky, in 1893, and was granted State Certificate in
Kentucky in 1894. Was principal of Minerva Male and Female
Academy 1896-1898, when he gave up teaching to enter the insurance
business, in which he has been engaged to the present time.</p>

<p>Brother Fite was a charter member of Rising Sun Tribe, No.
161, of Bethel, Ohio, instituted in May, 1893, in which Tribe he
gained the honors of a Past Sachem. While engaged at teaching
in Augusta he assisted at the institution of Paughcaughnaughsinque
Tribe, No. 6, and became a charter member of that Tribe, aiding
materially in its progress. He was a charter member of the Great
Council of Kentucky and was elected its first Great Junior Sagamore,
succeeding as Great Senior Sagamore, and was elected Great
Sachem at Ashland, serving the Great Council with distinction, and
at the close of his term was elected Great Prophet. Having moved
from the Reservation before the expiration of his term in the latter
chieftaincy, he was succeeded by Past Great Sachem Thos. A. Hornsey.
He was a member of the Committee on Laws which formulated
the first code adopted by the Great Council, and served at
times on various other important committees. He was appointed
by Great Sachem Winter as a Special Deputy for the purpose of
visiting various Tribes in the Reservation, and through his instrumentality
many weak Tribes were made strong and placed upon
the highway to success.</p>

<p>Brother Fite now resides in Jackson, Ohio, and is engaged in
the insurance business. He is an active member in the Knights
of Pythias, Odd Fellows, Masons, as well as the Improved Order of
Red Men.

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM JOHN ISAAC WINTER</b><br /><br />

1898-9</h3>

<p>John Isaac Winter was born at Germantown, Bracken County,
Kentucky, February 20, 1870, and was educated at the Bracken
Academy, Augusta. At the early age of sixteen he entered business
in that city, at which he was successful, and continued there until
December, 1897, when he moved to Maysville, Kentucky, where
he opened up one of the largest furniture stores in the State, known
as "The White Palace," which he continues to conduct with marked
success.</p>

<p>Brother Winter was made a Red Man at the institution of
Paughcaughnaughsinque Tribe, No. 6, at Augusta, and was its first
Sachem, filling that stump with distinguished ability, and to his
energy and zeal is due in a large measure the firm establishment
of that Tribe at its inception. As a ritualist he excelled, and one
who has ever seen "John Ike," as he is familiarly called, as Sachem
in the Adoption Degree will never forget it. He was a charter
member of the Great Council of Kentucky and a moving spirit at
its founding, being appointed its first Great Sannap, succeeding
as Great Junior Sagamore, Great Senior Sagamore, and was elected
Great Sachem at Winchester in 1898.</p>

<p>Much constructive work was accomplished during his administration,
the "newness" of things having somewhat disappeared, the
superficial giving place to the real, and the actual foundation was
laid for the solid structure afterwards erected.</p>

<p>He is actively identified with the Odd Fellows, Knights of
Pythias, Elks, the Blue Lodge, Chapter and Commandery in Masonry,
a deacon in the Central Presbyterian Church of Maysville,
and is actively interested in church work.

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM W. C. DIEDERICH.</b><br /><br />

1899-1900</h3>

<p>W. C. Diederich was born in Old Hanover, Germany, November
26, 1849. At an early age he came to this country and was
educated in the common schools. He was adopted into the Improved
Order of Red Men in Huron Tribe, No. 19, of Ashland,
which Tribe he served as Sachem, having been one of its promoters
and most enthusiastic members.</p>

<p>Brother Diederich was a charter member of the Great Council
of Kentucky, and having been previously admitted to the Great
Council of Ohio, was appointed by the Great Incohonee as Great
Guard of the Wigwam. He served as a member of the first Committee
on Law and Usage, was appointed Great Michinewa by
Great Sachem McConnell, at Augusta in 1896, and at the third
session of the Great Council, held in the wigwam of his own Tribe
at Ashland, in 1897, he was elected Great Junior Sagamore, succeeding
as Great Senior Sagamore in 1898, and at Louisville, in
1899, he was elected Great Sachem. During his administration
the first great increase in the number of Tribes was brought about,
he having appointed as Organizer J. B. VanZandt, who was successful
in getting Tribes, though for some reason but few Tribes
instituted by him are alive and working at this day. Brother
Diederich was at one time claimed to be accountable for the misdeeds
of his deputy, but upon investigation it was clearly shown
he was in no manner responsible, and he was completely exonerated.
Brother Diederich was and is of sterling integrity, sound
and honest to the core, and this matter is here mentioned simply
as a matter of history, and in no way should reflect upon his honor.</p>

<p>Brother Diederich is now engaged in the grocery business in
Ashland, and attends the sessions of the Great Council with regularity,
enjoying the marked prosperity of the Order, though he has
relinquished the active work to younger heads.

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM WILLIE WALKER</b><br /><br />

1900-1</h3>

<p>Willie Walker was born in Ohio County, Kentucky, on Rough
Creek, near a small postoffice at that time called Pattysville, but
now called Shreve. He worked on a farm until past twenty-one,
receiving only the country common school education. Later he
attended Hartford College for a term, and afterward taught school
in Ohio County in 1883. In 1884-86 he attended the State A. &amp;
M. College (now State University), at Lexington, and between sessions
sold books to obtain money to pursue his studies, and a part
of the time worked on the State College farm to pay board.</p>

<p>In 1891 he accepted a position as bookkeeper with the firm of
DeLong &amp; Co., Lexington, with whom, and succeeding firms, he
remained for five years, when in 1895 he engaged in the implement
business, where he continued until 1900, when he became Manager
of the Huber Manufacturing Co. for Central and Eastern Kentucky,
which position he now holds.</p>

<p>Brother Walker was adopted into Miantonomo Tribe, No. 1,
on the sleep of December 6th, 1894, was elected Junior Sagamore
a few suns later, receiving his Past Sachem's Certificate in April,
1895, and was admitted to the Great Council of Kentucky the following
month at Ashland, when he was appointed a member of
the Committee on Returns and Reports. The following great sun,
at Winchester, he was elected Great Junior Sagamore, succeeding
as Great Senior Sagamore in 1899, and was elected Great Sachem
at Lexington in 1900. During his administration there was a great
revival in Redmanship, thirty-two new Tribes having been instituted,
and it was many great suns later before the feat was equaled.
At the close of his administration he was elected Great Prophet
and Great Representative to the Great Council of the United
States for two great suns, and was the first retiring Great Sachem
to be thus honored.</p>

<p>Brother Walker was always an enthusiast regarding a Widows'
and Orphans' Home, and the first mention of such a project was
made by him in his Long Talk as Great Sachem, he at that time
recommending that a committee be appointed to devise ways and
means for the establishment of such an institution.

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM GUSTAV AUGUST ELLERKAMP</b><br /><br />

1901-2</h3>

<p>The subject of our sketch was born September 30, 1858, at
Hoom, Kingdom of the Netherlands. Upon the death of his father
in 1868 he moved to Hanover, Germany, where he attended the
public schools, emigrating to this country in 1873, landing in Louisville
July 30th of that year, unacquainted with the English language
and the customs of the people. He was engaged in the grocery
business until 1892, when he took a position with C. F. Vissman
Co., where he remained fifteen and a half years, and rose to
be manager of their branch house, making it a success. He attended
the Jefferson School of Law during the winters of 1905-6
and 1906-7, graduating with honors in May, 1907. He was admitted
to the bar April 23, 1907, at Brandenburg, Meade County.</p>

<p>Brother Ellerkamp was a charter member of Shawnee Tribe,
No. 9, at Louisville, and was one of the few faithful members of
that Tribe to hold out against the desertion of nearly 150 members,
leaving about 18 to shoulder a debt of several hundred fathoms
which was finally paid off. Later Brother Ellerkamp became a
member of Cherokee Tribe, No. 8, when the Tribes consolidated.
While a member of No. 9 he was admitted to the Great Council of
Kentucky in 1899, and at the same session was elected Great Junior
Sagamore, being advanced to the stump of Great Senior Sagamore
the following great sun, and was elected Great Sachem at Danville
in 1901. During his administration great work was done for the
uplifting of the Order, and while he had much to contend with
he made for himself an enviable reputation, even though he was
sick a large portion of the year, and could only direct the action
of able lieutenants. At the conclusion of his term as Great Sachem
he was elected Great Prophet and Great Representative to the
Great Council of the United States for two great suns. He was
elected again for two great suns in 1905, and re-elected in 1907,
where he is now serving. He has served upon many important
committees in the Great Council of the United States, and was a
member of the Committee on Permanent Long House, and to his
good offices on that committee is largely due the selection of Louisville
as the permanent location of that building. He was a member
of the Committee on Law and Usage that edited and arranged
the present code of laws of the Great Council of Kentucky.</p>

<p>Brother Ellerkamp is now practicing law in the hunting grounds
of Louisville, and is as ardent a Red Man as ever, attending the
councils of his Tribe and never missing a session of the Great
Council of Kentucky.

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM JOHN D. WALKER</b><br /><br />

1902</h3>

<p>The subject of our sketch was born in Brooksville, Bracken
County, Kentucky, and lived there for thirty years. He attended
the public schools, and at an early age learned the carpenter's
trade with his father. He enlisted in the Confederate army during
the Civil War, and at its close returned to Brooksville and again
took up carpentering, but shortly afterwards engaged in a manufacturing
enterprise that proved profitable for a time. In 1870
he bought out the drug store of Dr. J. D. Wallins, and conducted
that business for several years, when he attended the Ohio Medical
College at Cincinnati, from which institution he was graduated
and returned to his drug business, practicing medicine in connection
with the same. At that time Bracken County produced large
quantities of tobacco, and he became interested in buying tobacco
together with his other duties, becoming so much interested in this
latter enterprise that he devoted his whole energies to this industry.
Becoming interested in politics, he was elected chief of police
for a term of two years, at the end of which time he was elected
sheriff, and served as such for two years, continuing all the time
to handle leaf tobacco. Being successful, he sought a larger field
and went to Cincinnati, where he conducted a leaf tobacco brokerage
business, and while meeting with success, he was induced to
take the road for a large plug and twist tobacco manufacturer.
While on the road he was induced to move to Lexington, where he
organized the Blue Grass Tobacco Company in 1886, and for about
eighteen years he superintended that business, until recently he
established the White Plume Tobacco Company at Lexington, of
which he is now the manager.</p>

<p>Brother Walker was a charter member of Winona Tribe, No. 4,
of Lexington, and received the honors of a Past Sachem by virtue
of being its first Keeper of Wampum, which position he held during
the existence of the Tribe. He was admitted to the Great Council
in 1895, and was elected Great Keeper of Wampum in 1897,
serving as such for five consecutive great suns, and in 1892 was
granted the honors of a Past Great Sachem and elected Great Representative
to the Great Council of the United States for two great
suns. He is now a member of Miantonomo Tribe, No. 1, is a regular
attendant at the sessions of the Great Council, and has the good
will and confidence of every member of that Great Body.

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM WILLIAM CREERE PELHAM</b><br /><br />

1902-3</h3>

<p>Brother Pelham was born December 2, 1846, at New Harmony,
Indiana, and was educated at the "Maysville Literary Institute,"
a preparatory school. His parents died before he was three years
of age, and his family moved to Maysville, Ky., where he resided
until September, 1893, when he moved to Knoxville, Tenn., where
he is now connected with A. Greenwood &amp; Co., an incorporation,
as Secretary-Treasurer. Brother Pelham was a civil engineer and
surveyor of wide reputation while residing in Maysville. He was
a charter member of Wyandotte Tribe, No. 3, and one of its early
Sachems, yielding the tomahawk with remarkable dexterity. Bro.
Pelham was one of those rare characters that is never "rattled,"
no matter how aggravating the occasion.</p>

<p>He was admitted to the Great Council of Kentucky at Augusta
in 1896. He served as chairman of the Committee on Law and
Usage during 1897-8, making many important rulings that have
stood as law until this day, and was appointed chairman of the
same committee for the year 1898-9, and again for 1899-1900. He
was unable to attend the session of the Great Council held at Lexington
in 1900, nevertheless he was then elected Great Junior Sagamore,
and was raised to his stump in the wigwam of his own Tribe
the next day. The following great sun he was elected Great Senior
Sagamore, and was elected Great Sachem at Owensboro in 1902.
During his administration he made but little effort to institute new
Tribes, preferring to bend his energies toward building up those
already existing. To this end he appointed an exemplifier, and for
three moons kept him on the road, making a tribal visit nearly
every sleep, during that time visiting more than forty hunting
grounds. The experiment was costly, but exceedingly profitable,
and many of the Tribes then visited have been anxiously awaiting
its repetition, but in vain. At the close of his term he was elected
Great Prophet and Great Representative to the Great Council of
the United States for two great suns, but his removal from the
Reservation disqualified him from serving more than one year, and
the Great Council of Kentucky has been deprived of his wise counsel
since. Brother Pelham is still a member of Wyandotte Tribe,
No. 3, of Maysville. He says of himself that he is a "Democrat
by conviction, a Methodist by choice, and a Red Man by adoption."

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM CHARLES E. LYDDANE</b><br /><br />

1903</h3>

<p>The subject of this sketch was born in Clark County, Kentucky,
December 26, 1852, where he has ever lived. He was raised on a
farm, and at the age of twenty years began teaching in the country
schools, and continued in this work twelve years. He began reportorial
work in 1884 on the Winchester Democrat, and has been
with that paper ever since, having been editor-in-chief since 1890.</p>

<p>He was twice elected County Superintendent of Schools and
served in that capacity eight years; also served eight years more
as member of the County Board of Examiners.</p>

<p>Brother Lyddane was a charter member of Shawnee Tribe, No.
18, organized at Winchester in 1887, under the jurisdiction of the
Great Council of Ohio, and was the first Sachem of the Tribe.
This Tribe became defunct, and he became a charter member of
Miantonomo Tribe, No. 1, of Lexington, withdrawing a few suns
later to become a charter member of Onequa Tribe, No. 2, of Winchester,
which was instituted the 29th of Cold Moon, G. S. D. 404.
and has served that Tribe as Chief of Records for many great suns,
being still in the harness.</p>

<p>He was admitted to the Great Council of Kentucky in 1898, at
Winchester, and was then elected Great Chief of Records, which
position he held for the next five consecutive great suns, when he
retired with the honors of Past Great Sachem. For the past few
great suns he has not been in robust health, and has attended but
few sessions of the Great Council.</p>

<p>Brother Lyddane believes in fraternities, and besides his connection
with the Red Men, he is a Past Master of the Masonic Order,
Past Grand of the Odd Fellows, Past Regent of the Royal Arcanum,
and is a high private in the ranks of the Knights of
Pythias. He is a Democrat in politics and a Baptist in religion.</p>

<p>He was married in 1890 to Miss Fannie Bailey, of Winchester,
and has a happy home, but no children.

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM HENRY HERMAN DENHARDT</b><br /><br />

1904-5</h3>

<p>Brother Denhardt was born March 8, 1876, at Bowling Green,
Kentucky, and received his early education in the public schools
of that city, later attending Ogden College, and was graduated from
Cumberland University, Lebanon, Tenn., with the degree of LL. B.</p>

<p>Since his graduation he has been practicing law in his native
city, and for the past eight great suns has been prosecuting attorney.</p>

<p>He became a member of Mohican Tribe, No. 11, by adoption,
in April, 1896, and soon after he was advanced to the stump of
Sachem. He has also served his Tribe as Chief of Records for
several great suns.</p>

<p>Brother Denhardt was admitted to the Great Council of Kentucky
at Lexington in 1900, and has attended every session of the
Great Council since. He was elected Great Junior Sagamore at
Owensboro in 1902, serving as Great Senior Sagamore in 1903,
and at Paducah in 1904 he was elected Great Sachem. Five great
suns prior to his being raised to the Great Sachem's stump a movement
had been started looking towards a Widows' and Orphans'
Home, but no decisive action had been taken, and Brother Denhardt
warmly espoused this cause, and through his ardent efforts
a law was finally adopted creating a fund for this purpose. At the
close of his term as Great Sachem he was elected Great Prophet
and Representative to the Great Council of the United States for
two great suns, and at the expiration of his term in 1907 he was
re-elected for another two great suns.</p>

<p>At the session of the Great Council of the United States, held
at Bridgeport, Conn., in Cold Moon, G. S. D. 417, Brother Denhardt
was appointed by Great Incohonee Farrar a member of the
Judiciary Committee, one of the most important standing committees
of the Great Council of the United States.</p>

<p>While Great Sachem of the Great Council of Kentucky, Brother
Denhardt became a Benedict, and his charming wife is a regular
attendant at the sessions of the Great Council of Kentucky and of
the Great Council of the United States.

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM LEWIS L. BEBOUT</b><br /><br />

1905-6</h3>

<p>The subject of this sketch was born October 6, 1874, at Smithland,
Kentucky, and when twelve years old removed with his parents
to Crittenden County, near Marion. He received a common
school education in Crittenden and Marion County schools, and
became editor, owner and publisher of the "Marion Monitor," a
weekly newspaper at Marion, Ky., at the age of nineteen. He continued
in this business but a few months, when he sold out the
entire plant and moved to Paducah in 1894.</p>

<p>Enlisting as private in Co. K, 3rd Ky. U. S. V. Infty. during
the Spanish-American War, he was made 1st Sergeant of his company,
and was commissioned 2d Lieutenant in October, 1898, at
Lexington. He commanded the company longer than either of the
other officers and was in sole command, and remained so, while the
company was in Cuba. At the close of this service he returned to
Paducah and engaged in the insurance business, which he is most
successfully conducting at the present time.</p>

<p>He was a charter member of Otego Tribe, No. 60, and its first
C. of W., and afterwards Chief of Records. When Otego Tribe
gave a pow-wow and incurred a debt of several hundred fathoms,
he with nine other brothers borrowed the necessary money and paid
off the entire debt, in the face of the predicted collapse of the Tribe.
Nothing daunted, he with other faithful brothers inaugurated a
hunt for palefaces, with the result that 106 were captured and
adopted at one time, thus equaling the work of Miantonomo Tribe,
No. 1, which accomplished the same feat in 1895.</p>

<p>He was admitted to the Great Council of Kentucky at Owensboro
in 1902, and was at once put forward as a candidate for Great
Junior Sagamore, but without immediate success. He was, however,
at this Council appointed chairman of the Committee on
State of the Order, and at the following session of the Great Council,
at Maysville, he was successful and was raised to the stump of
Great Junior Sagamore, succeeding the following great sun as Great
Senior Sagamore, and in 1905, at Frankfort, he was elected Great
Sachem. His administration was conservative and the Order prospered
under his judicious rulings.</p>

<p>He was elected Great Prophet at the close of his term as Great
Sachem, and was also elected Great Representative to the Great
Council of the United States for two great suns, at the close of
which term he was returned for another term of like duration.</p>

<p>Brother Bebout married during his chieftaincy of Great Sachem
and the presence of his fair lady adds a charm to the social feature
of the Great Council.

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM DAN H. RUSSELL</b><br /><br />

1906-7</h3>

<p>Dan H. Russell was born April 7, 1873, at Springfield, Ohio,
and was given a liberal education, graduating from college with
high honors. A young man of remarkable pluck and push, through
trials that would have discouraged any but one of such indomitable
will, he "made good," and is the president of one of the large corporations
of the city of Louisville, where he has resided for many
years.</p>

<p>Brother Russell became a Red Man by adoption into Wahoo
Tribe in 1900, and was immediately put in line for the Sachem's
stump, which position he filled with great success, and piloted the
Tribe through perilous times. He was admitted to the Great Council
of Kentucky in 1903, at Maysville, and the same spirit that
prompted him in his business relations to forge to the front urged
him to seek preferment in the Great Council. Like many of his
predecessors, he was not successful the first time trying, but in
1904, at Paducah, he was elected Great Junior Sagamore, the following
great sun being promoted to the stump of Great Senior
Sagamore, and in 1906, at Frankfort, was elected Great Sachem.
His administration was noted for exceeding vigor, giving much of
his valuable time to the interests of the Order. He inaugurated
an active canvass for new Tribes, and Kentucky, under his leadership,
made a record for new Tribes instituted in one great sun, 45
Tribes having been added to the roster of the Great Council.</p>

<p>At the close of his term he was accorded the usual honor of
being elected Great Prophet and Great Representative to the Great
Council of the United States for two great suns, where he is now
serving.

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM ROBERT LEE PAGE</b><br /><br />

1907-8</h3>

<p>Robert Lee Page was born in Allen County, Kentucky, August
18, 1879. His maternal and paternal ancestors were natives of
Virginia, and he is of the celebrated Page family of that Commonwealth.</p>

<p>He was educated in the public schools of Louisville and a graduate
of the Louisville Male High School and the Louisville Normal
School. After completing his academic course he entered the law
department of the University of Louisville, graduating with the
highest honor of a class of thirty-five.</p>

<p>Shortly after starting the practice of law Brother Page was
appointed Assistant County Attorney of Jefferson County. In
June, 1907, he was appointed County Attorney and served in that
capacity until the general election, when he declined to be a candidate
to succeed himself, preferring to devote his entire time to his
private practice. At the time he was County Attorney of Jefferson
County he was the youngest official ever holding that office in the
county.</p>

<p>Brother Page was a charter member of Ptocawa Tribe, No. 80,
of Louisville, and the peculiar spelling of the name is accounted
for from the fact that superfluous letter "P" was prefixed as a
compliment to him. He served as the first Sachem of the Tribe,
and was admitted to the Great Council of Kentucky in 1902, at
Owensboro, and was appointed chairman of the Committee on Returns
and Reports by Great Sachem Pelham, and the following
great sun he was appointed to the same position by Great Sachem
McFarlan. At Owensboro, in 1904, he was elected Great Representative
to the Great Council of the United States for two great suns.
At Frankfort, in 1905, he was elected Great Junior Sagamore, the
following great sun being advanced to the stump of Great Senior
Sagamore, and at Lexington, in 1907, he was elected Great Sachem.
During his term the record was broken for the number of new
Tribes instituted during one great sun, 65 standing to his credit.
At the time of his election as Great Sachem he was but 27 years
of age, and he was doubtless the youngest Great Sachem in the
United States. At the close of his term as Great Sachem he was
accorded the usual honors of being elected Great Prophet and
Great Representative to the Great Council of the United States for
two great suns.

<h3><b>PAST GREAT SACHEM HENRY WOOD RAY</b><br /><br />

1908</h3>

<p>Brother Ray was born February 10, 1866, at Bowling Green,
Kentucky, and when but four months old his father died, his
mother then moving to Maysville. His schooling was very limited,
as at an early age he felt called upon to help maintain his mother
by learning the drug business. He entered the employ of J. Chenoweth,
at Maysville, in 1880, and remained with the same house
sixteen years, at the end of which time he bought out a drug store
in the same city, and remained in business for himself until 1907,
when he was compelled to retire on account of failing health, caused
by close attention to his business, coupled with his arduous duties
as Great Chief of Records. He had for years the largest and best
equipped drug store in Maysville.</p>

<p>Brother Ray was adopted into Wyandotte Tribe, No. 3, in
March, 1896, and served in various chieftaincies, earning his honors
as a Past Sachem. He was admitted to the Great Council of
Kentucky in 1899 at Louisville, serving then as representative of
his Tribe. At Lexington, in 1900, he was appointed by Great
Sachem Willie Walker chairman of the Committee on Returns and
Reports, and the following great sun by Great Sachem Ellerkamp
a member of the Finance Committee, and at Owensboro, in 1902,
he was made chairman of that committee by Great Sachem Pelham.</p>

<p>At the Great Council held in Maysville, 1903, he was, on the
retirement of C. E. Lyddane, unanimously elected Great Chief of
Records, and he served in that capacity for five consecutive great
suns, being accorded the honors of a Past Great Sachem at Frankfort,
in 1908, when he was elected Great Representative to the
Great Council of the United States for two great suns.</p>

<p>During the five great suns of his administration of the chieftaincy
of Great Chief of Records he managed the business end of
the Order in the Reservation in the same methodical way that
characterized his private affairs, and saw the Order grow from a
membership of 5,089 to 11,950: from 65 Tribes to 182 Tribes.
The lay member of the Order has no conception of the vast labors
performed by a faithful Great Chief of Records, but a small portion
of his duties being apparent to the casual observer. Brother
Ray was ever faithful to every duty, and earned the soubrequet of
"The Minute Man." The whole may be summed up in the words,
"He was always there with the goods."</p>

<p>Brother Ray is now filling a position as clerk in the State
Auditor's office at Frankfort.

<h3>HORACE J. McFARLAN<br /><br />

<b>PAST GREAT SACHEM HORACE J. McFARLAN</b><br /><br />

1903-4</h3>

<p>As a young man, Brother McFarlan was deeply interested in
base ball, and made it a profession. For quite a number of years
he was a favorite umpire in the National League. Prior to his
activity in base ball circles he had received a liberal education, and
tiring of the nomadic life consequent upon following the National
game for a livelihood, he studied law, was admitted to the bar, married
and began practice of his profession at Lagrange, where for
some time he was County Attorney.</p>

<p>Brother McFarlan was adopted into Massasoit Tribe, No. 33,
of Lagrange, and was one of its early Sachems. He was admitted
to the Great Council of Kentucky in 1901, at Danville, and at the
same session was put forward as a "dark horse" for Great Junior
Sagamore, winning the race against a large field. He served as
Great Senior Sagamore in 1902, and at Maysville, in 1903, he was
elected Great Sachem. During his chieftaincy he had the distinction
of dedicating the first wigwam owned by a Tribe of the Improved
Order of Red Men in the Reservation of Kentucky, that
of Oswego Tribe, No. 37, hunting grounds of Dry Ridge. This
took place on 18th of Traveling Moon, G. S. D. 412, and was made
the occasion of a great pow-wow, in which the citizens of the little
town most heartily joined. At the close of his term as Great
Sachem he was elected Great Prophet and Representative to the
Great Council of the United States for two great suns. In consequence
of the death of his estimable wife during the great sun of
414 he was unable to attend the Great Council of the United States,
and another was appointed in his stead, but in G. S. D. 415 he
was returned for an additional two great suns.</p>

<p>Brother McFarlan is at present practicing law in the hunting
grounds of Louisville.</p>
